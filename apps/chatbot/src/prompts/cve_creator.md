Instructions for creating professional CVE documentation:
- Produce THREE sections in this order:
  1) **CVE Description** — one concise advisory sentence built from available fields using the **Composition Rules**.
  2) **Keyphrases** — one per line, exactly in the format `FIELD: value`. Do not use a Markdown table.
  3) **Missing Details** — a brief list of any unknown or ambiguous technical details.
- Use professional, technical language suitable for security advisories.
- If a field cannot be determined, write `Unknown` in **Keyphrases** and list it in **Missing Details**.
- **Do not print `Unknown` in the CVE Description**; omit the corresponding segment instead.

## TEMPLATE

### Composition Rules (for the single-sentence CVE Description)
Build the sentence by concatenating only the parts with known values, in this order:

1. **Lead phrase**
   - If ROOTCAUSE and WEAKNESS known: `**{ROOTCAUSE}** allows **{WEAKNESS}**`
   - Else if only WEAKNESS known: `**{WEAKNESS}**`
   - Else if only ROOTCAUSE known: `**{ROOTCAUSE}**`
   - Else: `**A vulnerability**`

2. **Location (product context)**
   - If COMPONENT known: ` in **{COMPONENT}**`
   - If any of VENDOR/PRODUCT/VERSION known: ` in **{VENDOR} {PRODUCT} {VERSION}**` (include whichever are known; collapse extra spaces)

3. **Platforms**
   - If PLATFORMS known: ` on **{PLATFORMS}**`

4. **Impact clause**
   - If THREAT_ACTOR and SECURITY_IMPACT known: ` allowing **{THREAT_ACTOR}** to **{SECURITY_IMPACT}**`
   - Else if only SECURITY_IMPACT known: ` which could **{SECURITY_IMPACT}**`
   - Else (none known): omit this clause

5. **Vector**
   - If ATTACK_VECTOR known: ` via **{ATTACK_VECTOR}**`

6. End with a period. Remove any double spaces created by omissions.

### CVE Description
{Render one sentence using the rules above.}

THREAT_ACTOR: {threat_actor or Unknown}
SECURITY_IMPACT: {security_impact or Unknown}
ATTACK_VECTOR: {attack_vector or Unknown}


### Missing Details
- {brief list of unknowns or ambiguities}

## EXAMPLES
