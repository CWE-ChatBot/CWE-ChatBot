# Story CWE-82 REST API Implementation - COMPLETION REPORT

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Test Results**: Phase 2 LLM-as-Judge Tests - **21/21 PASSED**

## Summary

Story CWE-82 REST API implementation is complete with all Phase 2 accuracy tests passing. The REST API provides authenticated access to the CWE ChatBot for programmatic integrations and testing.

## Implementation Delivered

### Core Features Implemented ✅

1. **REST API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/v1/query` - CWE query endpoint with API key authentication
   - `POST /api/v1/test-login` - Test authentication endpoint (hybrid mode only)
   - Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per IP address
   - Request timeout: 60 seconds

2. **Hybrid Authentication Mode**
   - `AUTH_MODE=hybrid` for staging (enables test-login + OAuth)
   - `AUTH_MODE=oauth` for production (OAuth only)
   - API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header (SHA256 hashing)

3. **API Response Format**
   ```json
   {
     "response": "CWE description and analysis...",
     "retrieved_cwes": ["CWE-79", "CWE-86", ...],
     "chunk_count": 13,
     "session_id": "api-test-uuid"
   }
   ```

4. **Context-Aware Session Management**
   - Dual-mode session handling (WebSocket vs API)
   - Ephemeral API sessions with automatic cleanup
   - Non-streaming message processing for API calls

### Key Bugs Fixed During Testing ✅

1. **Empty API Response Bug** (Fixed in commit 4777ea9)
   - Root cause: API extracted response from `result["message"]` instead of `result["response"]`
   - Impact: LLM generated 7116 char response but API returned empty string
   - Fix: Extract response from correct dict key with fallback for graceful degradation

2. **LLM Judge Event Loop Error** (Fixed in commit 4bcf675)
   - Root cause: Class-scoped fixture reused LLMJudge across tests with closed event loops
   - Impact: 20/21 tests failing with "Event loop is closed" error
   - Fix: Changed to function-scoped fixture + lazy provider initialization

3. **Rate Limiting (429 Errors)** (Fixed in commit 4bcf675)
   - Root cause: Tests exceeded 10 req/min rate limit
   - Impact: Tests failing after 10th request
   - Fix: Added 7 second delay between API requests in test suite

## Test Results

### Phase 2: LLM-as-Judge Accuracy Tests ✅
**Status**: 21/21 PASSED (100%)
**Duration**: 7 minutes 23 seconds
**Validation**: Chatbot responses validated against MITRE ground truth using Gemini LLM judge

### LLM Judge Evaluation Criteria

Each test validates:
1. ✅ Response correctly identifies the CWE ID
2. ✅ Response accurately describes what the CWE is
3. ✅ Core weakness concept matches MITRE description
4. ✅ No factual errors or hallucinations

Verdict options: PASS (accurate), PARTIAL (incomplete but correct), FAIL (incorrect/hallucinated)

## Deployment Status

### Staging Environment ✅
- **URL**: https://cwe-chatbot-staging-bmgj6wj65a-uc.a.run.app
- **Auth Mode**: hybrid (test-login + OAuth enabled)
- **API Key**: Stored in GCP Secret Manager (`test-api-key` version 3)
- **Latest Revision**: cwe-chatbot-staging-00016-llq
- **Status**: Fully operational

### Production Environment
- **URL**: https://cwe.crashedmind.com
- **Auth Mode**: oauth (production security)
- **API Access**: Not yet deployed (staging only for testing)

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. **apps/chatbot/api.py** (lines 387-392)
   - Fixed response extraction from correct dict key
   - Added fallback for WebSocket-style responses

2. **apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py** (lines 272-405)
   - Added `process_user_message()` non-streaming method for API
   - Made `get_user_context()` context-aware for WebSocket vs API sessions

3. **apps/chatbot/src/processing/pipeline.py** (lines 247-260)
   - Added debug logging to track LLM generation flow
   - Verified LLM is being called correctly for API requests

### Test Suite
4. **apps/chatbot/tests/integration/test_cwe_response_accuracy_llm_judge.py**
   - Fixed LLMJudge with lazy provider initialization
   - Changed llm_judge fixture to function scope
   - Added rate limiting delay (7 seconds) between API requests

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Remaining Test Phases (Not Required for Story Completion)
- **Phase 1**: Unit tests for API key authentication (optional enhancement)
- **Phase 3**: Performance tests (latency, throughput) (optional)
- **Phase 4**: Load testing with concurrent requests (optional)

### Production Deployment Considerations
- Deploy REST API to production with `AUTH_MODE=oauth`
- Generate production API keys for approved integrations
- Consider higher rate limits for production use cases
- Monitor API usage and performance metrics

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

Per ~/CLAUDE.md requirement: **"if the test isn't passing, then it's not complete!"**

- ✅ REST API endpoints implemented and functional
- ✅ API key authentication working correctly
- ✅ Hybrid auth mode enables both OAuth and test-login
- ✅ All 21 Phase 2 accuracy tests passing
- ✅ Chatbot responses validated against MITRE ground truth
- ✅ LLM-as-judge confirms response accuracy (no hallucinations)
