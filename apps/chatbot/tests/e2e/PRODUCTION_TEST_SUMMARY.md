# Production Test Summary - Non-CWE Query Regression Testing

**Test Date:** 2025-10-03
**Deployment:** cwe-chatbot-00097-mdz
**Test Type:** End-to-End Regression Testing
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED WITH REAL PRODUCTION DATA

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully captured real production timing and retrieval metrics from 5 test queries executed against the live production deployment. All queries successfully retrieved chunks, confirming no regression of the "No relevant CWE information found" bug.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All 5 queries retrieved 10 chunks successfully
- ✅ Zero errors in production logs
- ✅ Embedding generation: Excellent performance (~118ms avg)
- ⚠️ Database queries: Acceptable but ~1.2s slower than local (network latency)
- ✅ Top CWE accuracy: 3/5 perfect, 2/5 related CWEs

*First query includes cold start penalty (+2.5s)

**Averages (excluding cold start):**
- Embedding: 118ms
- Database: 1345ms
- Total: 1387ms

### Retrieval Quality

**Top CWE Results (with hybrid scores):**

1. **SQL Injection:** CWE-89 (0.52), CWE-89 (0.48), CWE-89 (0.47) - ✅ Perfect
2. **Buffer Overflow:** CWE-119 (0.68), CWE-120 (0.61), CWE-119 (0.58) - ✅ Excellent
3. **XSS Mitigation:** CWE-87 (0.61), CWE-80 (0.59), CWE-85 (0.59) - ⚠️ Related
4. **Path Traversal:** CWE-22 (0.51), CWE-22 (0.46), CWE-36 (0.43) - ✅ Perfect
5. **Auth Bypass:** CWE-305 (0.75), CWE-305 (0.67), CWE-1390 (0.62) - ⚠️ Related

**Hybrid Score Range:** 0.43 - 0.75 (reasonable relevance)

## Technical Validation

### ✅ Confirmed Working

1. **Hybrid Retrieval Architecture**
   - Vector similarity search operational
   - Full-text search operational
   - Alias matching operational (trigram-based)
   - All queries return 10 chunks as expected

2. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Embedding generation time captured
   - Database query time captured
   - Total processing time captured
   - Top CWE results with scores captured

3. **No Regression**
   - Zero "No relevant CWE information found" errors
   - All queries successfully retrieve chunks
   - query_hybrid method working correctly

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

1. **Candidate Pooling Stats Missing**
   - Expected: `Candidate pooling: vec=50, fts=18, alias=12, total=73`
   - Actual: Not appearing in logs
   - Likely cause: Silent exception in stats query
   - Impact: Diagnostic data missing (functionality unaffected)

2. **Database Performance Gap** ⚠️ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
   - Target: ~200ms
   - Actual: ~1345ms
   - Gap: ~1200ms per query
   - **Root Cause:** Connection not reused between queries (pg_chunk_store.py:144-161)
     - `_get_connection()` opens connection
     - Query executes
     - Connection immediately closed (defeats pooling!)
   - **Evidence:**
     - Both app and DB ARE co-located (us-central1) ✅
     - SQLAlchemy pool exists but connections closed immediately
     - Each query incurs IAM auth + SSL/TLS handshake overhead (~1s)
   - Impact: User experience (1.4s response time vs 0.2s target)

3. **XSS Query Accuracy**
   - Expected: CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
   - Actual: CWE-87 (Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax)
   - Analysis: CWE-87 is XSS-related but not primary CWE
   - Impact: Related but not optimal result

4. **Auth Bypass Query Accuracy**
   - Expected: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)
   - Actual: CWE-305 (Authentication Issues)
   - Analysis: CWE-305 is auth-related but not exact match
   - Impact: Related but not optimal result

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Performance) ⚠️ **CORRECTED**

1. **Fix Connection Reuse in pg_chunk_store.py** 🔥 **CRITICAL**
   - **Problem:** Connections closed immediately after each query (lines 144-161)
   - **Solution:** Keep connection open across queries OR use SQLAlchemy sessions properly
   - **Expected improvement:** ~1000-1200ms reduction (from 1345ms → ~150-200ms)
   - **Priority:** HIGH - This is the main performance bottleneck

2. ~~**Co-locate Application and Database**~~ ✅ **ALREADY DONE**
   - Both are in us-central1 (verified)
   - No cross-region latency

3. **Fix Candidate Pooling Logging**
   - Add explicit error logging in pg_chunk_store.py:525
   - Verify logger level is INFO not DEBUG
   - Test stats query independently

### Future (Accuracy)

4. **Improve Alias Mapping**
   - Add explicit "XSS" → CWE-79 alias boost
   - Add explicit "authentication bypass" → CWE-287 boost
   - Consider increasing w_alias weight for acronym queries

5. **Optimize Trigram Similarity**
   - Create GIN indexes on alternate_terms_text and name (already recommended in R4.1)
   - Test similarity threshold tuning

### Future (Infrastructure)

6. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Implement playwright-based E2E tests (puppeteer has env issues)
   - Automate regression testing in Cloud Build pipeline

7. **Load Testing**
   - Validate performance under concurrent load
   - Test cold start frequency and impact
