# Story CWE-82 - LLM-as-Judge Test Verdicts

**Test Date**: October 12, 2025
**Judge Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite
**Test Results**: 21/21 PASSED (100%)
**Evaluation Method**: LLM-as-judge comparing chatbot responses against MITRE ground truth

## Sample Judge Verdicts

Below are sample verdicts captured from the test run showing how the LLM judge evaluated chatbot responses:

### High-Priority CWEs

#### CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
**Judge Verdict**: PASS
**Judge Reasoning**: The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-79, including the core weakness of improper neutralization of user input in web page generation. It provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, its variants, and mitigation strategies.

#### CWE-89: SQL Injection
**Judge Verdict**: PASS
**Judge Reasoning**: The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-89, including the core concept of improper neutralization of special elements. It provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, its impact, and mitigation strategies, without factual errors.

#### CWE-798: Hardcoded Credentials
**Judge Verdict**: PASS
**Judge Reasoning**: The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-798, including the core concept of hard-coded credentials and the associated risks. It also provides relevant remediation and prevention strategies.

### Low-Frequency CWEs

#### CWE-82: Improper Neutralization of Script in IMG Tags
**Judge Verdict**: PASS
**Judge Reasoning**: The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-82, including the core concept of improper neutralization of scripting elements in IMG tag attributes. The response provides a detailed explanation and remediation steps, aligning with the ground truth.

**Significance**: This is the CWE that inspired Story CWE-82! The test validates that the chatbot now correctly retrieves and explains this low-frequency CWE that was previously difficult to find.

#### CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
**Judge Verdict**: PASS
**Judge Reasoning**: The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-829, including the core concept of including untrusted functionality. It also provides relevant examples and mitigation strategies.

## LLM Judge Evaluation Criteria

The LLM judge evaluates each chatbot response against MITRE ground truth using these criteria:

1. **Correct CWE Identification**: Does the response correctly identify the CWE ID?
2. **Accurate Description**: Does the response accurately describe what the CWE is?
3. **Core Weakness Match**: Is the core weakness concept correct (matches MITRE description)?
4. **No Hallucinations**: Are there any factual errors or hallucinations?

### Verdict Guidelines

- **PASS**: Response is accurate and matches ground truth (may be brief but not wrong)
- **PARTIAL**: Response is incomplete but not incorrect (missing details but core concept right)
- **FAIL**: Response is incorrect, describes wrong CWE, or contains hallucinations

## Complete Test Coverage

### High-Priority CWEs (10 tests) ✅
All 10 tests validated chatbot accuracy for OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25:
- CWE-79 (XSS)
- CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
- CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)
- CWE-22 (Path Traversal)
- CWE-352 (CSRF)
- CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload)
- CWE-639 (Insecure Direct Object References)
- CWE-798 (Hardcoded Credentials)
- CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)
- CWE-918 (SSRF)

### Low-Frequency CWEs (10 tests) ✅
All 10 tests validated chatbot accuracy for edge cases with potential poor hybrid search:
- CWE-15 (External Control of System/Configuration)
- CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)
- **CWE-82 (Script in IMG Tags)** ⭐ Original bug!
- CWE-108 (Struts File Disclosure)
- CWE-182 (Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value)
- CWE-242 (Inherently Dangerous Function)
- CWE-324 (Key Past Expiration)
- CWE-470 (External Input to Select Classes)
- CWE-641 (Improper Restriction of File Names)
- CWE-829 (Untrusted Control Sphere)

### Random Sample (1 test) ✅
Validates 20 random CWEs to detect systematic issues.

## Validation Against Requirements

### Story CWE-82 Success Criteria
✅ **CWE-82 correctly retrieved**: Judge confirms "The response accurately identifies and describes CWE-82, including the core concept of improper neutralization of scripting elements in IMG tag attributes."

✅ **No hallucinations**: Judge evaluation confirms all responses align with MITRE ground truth without factual errors.

✅ **Comprehensive coverage**: 21/21 tests passing demonstrates chatbot handles both common (high-priority) and rare (low-frequency) CWEs correctly.

### LLM-as-Judge Reliability
The use of Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite as the judge provides:
- **Objective evaluation**: Deterministic temperature (0.0) for consistent judging
- **Ground truth validation**: Direct comparison against MITRE CWE database
- **Structured verdicts**: Clear PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with reasoning
- **False positive prevention**: Multiple criteria (ID, description, core concept, no hallucinations)

## Test Execution Details

**Test Command**: `./run_phase2.sh`
**Test Duration**: 7 minutes 23 seconds
**Rate Limiting**: 7 second delay between API requests (10 req/min limit compliance)
**API Endpoint**: `https://cwe-chatbot-staging-bmgj6wj65a-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/query`
**Authentication**: API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header

## Conclusion

The LLM-as-judge methodology successfully validates that Story CWE-82 REST API implementation delivers accurate, hallucination-free responses for both high-priority and low-frequency CWEs. The judge verdicts confirm the chatbot correctly identifies and explains CWE concepts, with particular success on CWE-82 (the original inspiration for this story).

**Key Achievement**: 100% test pass rate with objective LLM-based validation against MITRE ground truth.
