   - Compression enabled
   - Efficient asset delivery

### 🎯 Remaining Opportunities

According to the latest Lighthouse report, top optimization opportunities:

1. **Eliminate render-blocking resources** (309ms savings)
   - Move critical CSS inline
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Use async/defer attributes

2. **Reduce unused JavaScript** (280ms savings)
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Tree shaking optimization

3. **Reduce unused CSS** (30ms savings)

## Performance Impact Analysis

### User Experience Improvements

**Before Optimization:**
- Users waited **7.6 seconds** before seeing any content
- Page felt **unresponsive for 8.4 seconds**
- High risk of user abandonment (industry standard: 3s threshold)

**After Optimization:**
- Users see content in **1.5 seconds** ✅
- Page interactive in **1.6 seconds** ✅
- Well within acceptable performance thresholds

### Business Impact
