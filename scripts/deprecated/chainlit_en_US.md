# CWE ChatBot — About & Help

This assistant focuses on MITRE CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration). Ask about specific CWEs (e.g., CWE-79, CWE-89), prevention guidance, examples, and relationships.

Quick tips:
- Try: "What is CWE-79?" or "How do I prevent SQL injection?"
- Select your role from the top bar (Developer, PSIRT Member, etc.) for tailored responses.
- Use the gear icon next to the input to adjust detail level, examples, and mitigations.

Security & scope:
- The assistant is security-first. Off-topic questions are gently redirected.
- Potentially unsafe inputs are sanitized and may receive a safe fallback.

Sources & retrieval:
- Hybrid RAG over PostgreSQL with vector + keyword search.
- Responses cite CWE context and relevant sections (Description, Examples, Mitigations, Relationships).

Feedback:
- Use the feedback controls to rate responses and help us improve.
