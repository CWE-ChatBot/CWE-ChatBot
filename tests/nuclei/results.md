Update (October 24, 2025):
1. ✅ CAA Record added to DNS
2. ✅ Subresource Integrity (SRI) - FIXED by locally hosting fonts
   - Inter font family (Regular, Medium, SemiBold) now hosted at `/public/fonts/`
   - JetBrains Mono (Regular, Medium) now hosted at `/public/fonts/`
   - Removed Google Fonts CDN dependency from custom.css
   - Updated CSP to remove fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com
   - KaTeX CDN (cdn.jsdelivr.net) remains for Chainlit internal math rendering
3. Missing HTTP Security Headers
   1. Clear-Site-Data will not be used. There is no logout. OAuth tokens expire.
   2. X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: This is an older header used to control how Adobe Flash content accesses data across domains. Since Flash is no longer supported, this header is generally considered low-impact.


--------------------------------------------------

Here's a breakdown of what your Nuclei scan results mean.

Overall, the scan found **no critical vulnerabilities**. All the findings are `info` severity, which means they are informational or suggestions for security hardening, not immediate threats.

Your site already has many excellent security headers in place (like `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options`), which is great. The findings below are minor recommendations.

-----

## 1\. Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)

This is the most
actionable finding.

  * **What it means:** Your site loads two external stylesheets (one from `fonts.googleapis.com` and one from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`) without using Subresource Integrity (SRI).
  * **Why it matters:** SRI ensures that the file your site loads from an external source (like a CDN) hasn't been tampered with. If an attacker ever compromised `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, they could inject malicious code into the `katex.min.css` file, and your site would unknowingly serve it to your users. SRI prevents this by checking a cryptographic hash of the file.
  * **How to fix it:** You need to add an `integrity` attribute (with the file's hash) and a `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to the `<link>` tags.

**Before (Your current code):**

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.22/dist/katex.min.css"
/>
```

**After (What it should look like):**
You'll need to generate the correct hash for each file. You can use a tool like [srihash.org](https://www.srihash.org/) or use `openssl` in your terminal.

For example, the KaTeX file's hash is `sha384-v2S/bS/fS/k/S8V...` (this is just an example, you must generate the correct one). The tag would become:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.22/dist/katex.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-v2S/bS/fS/k/S8V...[REPLACE-WITH-CORRECT-HASH]...="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

*(Note: Google Fonts often presents challenges with SRI because the CSS file they serve can change based on the user's browser. You may choose to accept this risk for Google Fonts, but you should definitely apply SRI to the jsDelivr/KaTeX file.)*

## 2\. Missing HTTP Security Headers

  * **What it means:** The scan noted your server isn't sending two specific security headers: `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` and `Clear-Site-Data`.
  * **Why it matters:**
      * **`X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`:** This is an older header used to control how Adobe Flash content accesses data across domains. Since Flash is no longer supported, this header is generally considered low-impact.
      * **`Clear-Site-Data`:** This header can be used to tell a browser to clear all local data (cache, cookies, local storage) for your site. It's most useful for ensuring a clean state after a user logs out.
  * **How to fix it:** You can configure your web server (Google Frontend) to add these headers.
      * `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none`
      * `Clear-Site-Data: "cache", "cookies", "storage"` (This header is usually sent only on a logout response, not on every page).

## 3\. Informational Findings

These results are not issues but are just confirming your site's configuration.

  * **`TLS Version`:** Your server correctly supports modern, secure **TLS 1.2** and **TLS 1.3**. This is good.
  * **`Technology Detection`:** The scan identified that your site is served by **Google Frontend** (likely Google Cloud Load Balancer or App Engine) and uses **Google Font API** and **jsDelivr**. This is just fingerprinting.
  * **`SSL Issuer / DNS Names`:** This confirms your SSL certificate was issued by **Google Trust Services** and is valid for your domain, `staging-cwe.crashedmind.com`. This is all correct.
  * **`CAA Record`:** The scan noted you don't have a CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) record for this subdomain. A CAA record is a DNS setting that specifies *which* certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for your domain. Adding one is a good practice to prevent unauthorized certificate issuance. Since you use a Google certificate, you could add a DNS record like this:
    `staging-cwe.crashedmind.com. IN CAA 0 issue "pki.goog"`
