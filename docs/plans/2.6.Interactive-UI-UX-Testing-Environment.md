# UI/UX Testing Implementation Plan with Playwright

**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive interactive UI/UX testing environment using Playwright to validate Chainlit-based conversational interface functionality, role-based behaviors, and security features.

**Timeline**: 3 weeks  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 6 story points

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of Story 2.6, creating a robust browser automation testing framework that will validate UI functionality, role-based adaptations, progressive disclosure features, and security implementations in a real browser environment. The deliverable will be a comprehensive Playwright-based testing suite with interactive capabilities for both automated and manual testing scenarios.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Chainlit Application**: Conversational UI with WebSocket communication
- **Role-Based System**: 5 user roles with different UI adaptations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Dynamic action buttons and content expansion
- **Security Features**: MED-006 session encryption, MED-007 input sanitization
- **Backend Testing**: Unit and integration tests for Python components

### Testing Gaps
- **No Browser Automation**: Manual testing only for UI functionality
- **Limited Role Testing**: No automated validation of role-specific behaviors
- **Security Testing Gap**: Security features not validated in browser environment
- **Progressive UI Testing**: Dynamic content loading not systematically tested
- **Cross-Browser Coverage**: No multi-browser compatibility validation
- **Performance Validation**: No browser-based performance testing
