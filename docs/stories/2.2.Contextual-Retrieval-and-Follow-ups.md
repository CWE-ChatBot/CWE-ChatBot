# Story 2.2: Contextual Retrieval & Basic Follow-up Questions

**Status**: Completed ✅

## Story

**As a** chatbot user,
**I want** the system to provide contextually relevant CWE information and allow simple follow-up questions,
**so that** I can explore related details more deeply.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  When a CWE is successfully identified from a query, the system retrieves and presents comprehensive information (e.g., full description, common consequences, relationships to other CWEs or categories) from the vector database (NFR19), verifiable by local queries that return expected structured data.
2.  The system can understand and respond accurately to simple follow-up questions that are directly related to the previously discussed CWE context (e.g., "What are its common consequences?", "Give me an example", "How does this relate to X?"), verifiable through interactive local testing in the Chainlit UI.
3.  Responses to follow-up questions are extracted or synthesized directly from the detailed, stored CWE metadata, ensuring factual accuracy, verifiable by comparing chatbot output against raw CWE data locally.
4.  The ChatBot can respond to queries asking for "similar CWEs" by retrieving and listing related CWEs identified within the corpus (FR6).
5.  For detailed information, the ChatBot initially provides a concise answer or summary, with an explicit option or prompt for the user to request more in-depth details (FR5, NFR21).

## Security Requirements

1.  **Context Isolation:** The conversational context MUST be strictly isolated to the current user's session. There must be no possibility of one user's context leaking into another's session.
2.  **Data Minimization in Responses:** When synthesizing answers, the system MUST only use information from the retrieved CWE data and avoid incorporating external knowledge that could lead to information disclosure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Task 1: Enhance Retrieval Logic** (AC: 1, 4) ✅
    -   [x] Modify the vector DB retrieval function to fetch more comprehensive metadata for a matched CWE (full description, relationships, etc.).
    -   [x] Implement logic to specifically retrieve related CWEs based on the "ChildOf" or other relationship fields in the data.
-   [x] **Task 2: Implement Conversational Memory** (AC: 2, Security: 1) ✅
    -   [x] Integrate a simple, session-based memory mechanism into the Chainlit application to store the most recently discussed CWE ID.
    -   [x] Ensure this memory is scoped strictly to the individual user session.
-   [x] **Task 3: Develop Follow-up Query Processor** (AC: 2, 3) ✅
    -   [x] Enhance the NLU module to recognize simple follow-up intents (e.g., "tell me more", "what about...", "give an example").
    -   [x] If a follow-up intent is detected, use the CWE ID from the session memory to retrieve the relevant context for the answer.
-   [x] **Task 4: Implement Progressive Disclosure UI** (AC: 5) ✅
    -   [x] Update the response formatting to initially show a summary.
    -   [x] Add a UI element in Chainlit (e.g., a button or suggested reply) that allows the user to request more details.

## Dev Notes

* **Implementation Plan:** See detailed implementation plan at `/docs/plans/2.2.Contextual-Retrieval-and-Follow-ups.md`
* **Session State Management:** Chainlit provides user session management (`cl.user_session`). This should be used to store the context, like the current CWE being discussed, ensuring it's not stored in a global state.
* **Fact-Based Generation:** The core principle here is to ensure the LLM's role is primarily to *summarize* and *reformat* the factual context retrieved from the vector DB, not to generate new information. This is key to preventing hallucination.

## Testing

### Manual Verification

-   [x] Ask the chatbot for "CWE-79". Verify you get a concise summary.
-   [x] Click the "Tell me more" button and verify a more detailed description appears.
-   [x] As a follow-up, type "what are its children?" and verify the chatbot lists related, more specific CWEs.
-   [x] Open a new browser window/session, ask a different question, and verify the context from the first session does not interfere.

## Implementation Summary

**Completion Date:** August 27, 2025

### Key Components Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Database Retrieval (`/apps/chatbot/src/retrieval/`)**:
   - Extended `CWEResult` with relationships, consequences, extended descriptions
   - Added `CWERelationshipManager` for comprehensive CWE data retrieval
   - Mock relationship data generation for testing

2. **Session-Based Conversational Memory (`/apps/chatbot/src/session/`)**:
   - `SessionContextManager` with secure session isolation using Chainlit's `cl.user_session`
   - `SessionSecurityValidator` with contamination detection and security validation
   - Thread-safe session context management with timeout/cleanup mechanisms

3. **Follow-up Query Processing (`/apps/chatbot/src/processing/`)**:
   - `FollowupProcessor` with 8 different intent types (related, consequences, prevention, tell_more, children, parents, examples, general_followup)
   - `ContextualResponder` for generating context-aware responses
   - Enhanced pattern matching for conversational understanding

4. **Progressive Disclosure UI (`/apps/chatbot/src/formatting/`)**:
   - `ProgressiveResponseFormatter` with Chainlit action buttons
   - Summary and detailed response formatting
   - Interactive UI elements integrated into main.py with action callbacks

5. **Comprehensive Testing (`/tests/scripts/`)**:
   - 6 comprehensive test files covering all components
   - Unit tests, integration tests, security validation tests
   - Thread safety and session isolation testing

### Integration:
- All components fully integrated into `main.py` with context-aware message processing
- Progressive disclosure workflow implemented with action callback handlers
- Session security validation integrated into request handling pipeline
