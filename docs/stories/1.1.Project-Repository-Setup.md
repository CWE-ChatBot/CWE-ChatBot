# Story 1.1: Project Repository Setup

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a new project repository set up with a monorepo structure,
**so that** the team can begin organizing code and managing versions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The project repository is initialized on GitHub (or chosen VCS like GitLab/Bitbucket).
2.  A basic monorepo structure is established, including a root `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent for Python monorepo management) and an `apps/chatbot` directory for the main application.
3.  A `README.md` file is created at the repository root with an initial project description and basic setup instructions.
4.  An initial commit containing this foundational structure is pushed to the main branch.
5.  Standard `.gitignore` and `.env.example` files are present at the repository root to manage version control and environment variables.

## Security Requirements

1.  **Repository Security:** The `main` branch of the repository MUST be protected, requiring at least one peer review before code can be merged.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Repository** (AC: 1)
    -   [ ] Create a new repository on the chosen version control system (e.g., GitHub).
    -   [ ] Initialize a local Git repository.
    -   [ ] Add the remote origin.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Create Monorepo Structure** (AC: 2)
    -   [ ] Create the root `pyproject.toml` configured for a monorepo (e.g., using Poetry, PDM, or Hatch).
    -   [ ] Create the `apps/` directory.
    -   [ ] Create the `apps/chatbot/` subdirectory for the main application.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Create Initial Files** (AC: 3, 5)
    -   [ ] Create a `README.md` with the project title and a brief description.
    -   [ ] Create a comprehensive Python `.gitignore` file.
    -   [ ] Create an empty `.env.example` file to document required environment variables.
-   [ ] **Task 4: Make Initial Commit** (AC: 4)
    -   [ ] Add all created files to Git staging.
    -   [ ] Create an initial commit with a descriptive message (e.g., "Initial commit: project structure setup").
    -   [ ] Push the initial commit to the `main` branch of the remote repository.
-   [ ] **Task 5: Implement Security Requirements** (Security: 1)
    -   [ ] Configure branch protection rules for the `main` branch.
    -   [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging.
    -   [ ] Require at least one approval from a team member.

## Dev Notes

* **Architecture Decision Reference:** The PRD's "Technical Assumptions" section specifies a **Monorepo** structure. This is critical for organizing the Chainlit application alongside other potential Python services and shared components.
* **Python Monorepo Tooling:** The `pyproject.toml` should be configured to use a modern Python package and dependency manager that supports monorepos, such as **Poetry** or **PDM**. This will be crucial for managing dependencies between packages within the monorepo.

### Testing Standards

* **Test File Location:** All test files should be co-located with the source code in a `tests/` subdirectory within each package (e.g., `apps/chatbot/tests/`).
* **Testing Framework:** The project will use `pytest` as the primary testing framework.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

* N/A for this story.

### Integration Tests

* N/A for this story.

### Security Verification

-   [ ] **Branch Protection:** Manually verify in the VCS settings that the `main` branch protection rule is active and requires at least one review before merging.

### Manual Verification

-   [ ] Clone the newly created repository to a separate directory and confirm all files and the directory structure (`apps/chatbot`) are present.
-   [ ] Confirm that a direct push to the `main` branch is blocked for non-admin users.
