# Story S-9: Cloud Production Security Implementation

**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Security & Compliance  
**Status**: Draft  

## Story

**As a** Security Team Member,  
**I want** to implement comprehensive security controls for the cloud production environment,  
**so that** the CWE ChatBot meets enterprise security standards and compliance requirements before public deployment.

## Background

The vulnerability assessment identified several critical security gaps that must be addressed before cloud production deployment. While the SQL injection vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated, authentication, HTTPS enforcement, and other production security measures remain incomplete.

**Assessment Source**: docs/stories/2.1/Vulnerability-Assessment-Report.md  
**Overall Security Rating**: B+ (83/100) - Production-ready with authentication implementation
