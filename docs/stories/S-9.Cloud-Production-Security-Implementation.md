# Story S-9: Cloud Production Security Implementation

**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Security & Compliance  
**Status**: Not Implemented (framework/infrastructure gaps)  

## Story

**As a** Security Team Member,  
**I want** to implement comprehensive security controls for the cloud production environment,  
**so that** the CWE ChatBot meets enterprise security standards and compliance requirements before public deployment.

## Background

The vulnerability assessment identified several critical security gaps that must be addressed before cloud production deployment. While the SQL injection vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated, authentication, HTTPS enforcement, and other production security measures remain incomplete.

**Assessment Source**: docs/stories/2.1/Vulnerability-Assessment-Report.md  
**Overall Security Rating**: B+ (83/100) - Production-ready with authentication implementation

## Scope Clarification

S-9 focuses on production cloud infrastructure and edge enforcement on GCP (Cloud Run, Load Balancer/CDN, Cloud Armor, Secret Manager, Observability). App-level controls are defined and verified in related security stories and are not duplicated here:
- S-1: Rate Limiting and Budget Monitoring (application policies)
- S-2: LLM Input/Output Guardrails (prompt/response safety)
- S-3: API Authorization and Access Control (RBAC, endpoint authz)
- S-5: Harden Session and Authentication Flow (OAuth, session flags/CSP at app)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Auth Integration (Delegated; infra alignment)
1. **Provider Enablement (S-5/S-3)**
   - [ ] Enable OAuth (Google/GitHub only) in production config/environment
   - [ ] Provide client IDs/secrets via Secret Manager to Cloud Run
   - [ ] Document domain allowlist rules (if used) at deploy-time

### Edge Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection (Infra; see S-1 for app policy)
1. **Cloud Armor/Proxy Protections**
   - [ ] Configure Cloud Armor (or equivalent) rules for IP/user throttling
   - [ ] Enforce request size limits at LB/proxy layer
   - [ ] Enable basic bot and common attack mitigations (XSS/SQLi signatures)
2. **Platform Controls**
   - [ ] Set appropriate Cloud Run request timeout and concurrency
   - [ ] Add LB/URL map rules to reject oversize payloads early

### HTTPS & Edge Security Headers
1. **TLS/HTTPS**
   - [ ] Enforce TLS 1.2+/1.3 at the load balancer
   - [ ] Redirect HTTP→HTTPS at edge
   - [ ] Apply HSTS with long max-age at edge
2. **Headers (edge-injected)**
   - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) header injected at LB/gateway when static CSP is acceptable (S-5 covers app-side nonces if needed)
   - [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY; X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - [ ] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin; Permissions-Policy

### Container & Infrastructure Security
1. **Container Image Security**
   - [ ] SHA256-pinned base images in Dockerfile
   - [ ] Container vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
   - [ ] Multi-stage build with minimal runtime image
   - [ ] Non-root user execution (already implemented)

2. **Infrastructure Hardening**
   - [ ] Cloud Run service with minimum required permissions
   - [ ] VPC-native networking with private IPs
   - [ ] Cloud Load Balancer with DDoS protection
   - [ ] Resource limits and auto-scaling configuration

### Secrets & Configuration Management
1. **Cloud Secret Manager Integration**
   - [ ] Migrate from environment variables to Google Secret Manager
   - [ ] Automatic secret rotation for database credentials
   - [ ] API key rotation mechanism for OpenAI integration
   - [ ] Audit logging for all secret access

2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
   - [ ] Separate configurations for dev/staging/production
   - [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
   - [ ] Secure configuration validation
   - [ ] Environment variable encryption at rest

### Monitoring & Audit Logging
1. **Security Event Monitoring**
   - [ ] Failed authentication attempt alerting
   - [ ] Rate limit violation monitoring  
   - [ ] Suspicious query pattern detection
   - [ ] API abuse attempt logging

2. **Audit Trail Implementation**
   - [ ] User action logging (queries, exports, admin actions)
   - [ ] Security event correlation and analysis
   - [ ] Compliance-ready audit logs (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
   - [ ] Log retention and archival policies

## Security Requirements (References)

App-level security controls are defined and validated in related stories:
- Authentication, session management: S-5
- API authorization/RBAC: S-3
- Rate limiting/budget protections: S-1
- LLM input/output guardrails: S-2

S-9 ensures the production cloud environment enforces these via edge and platform configuration (TLS, headers, WAF/rate limits, secrets, observability).

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Architecture (Context)
```
User → Cloud Load Balancer → Cloud Run (CWE ChatBot)
                                ↓
                           OAuth Provider (Google/Microsoft)
                                ↓

## Implementation Review (2025-10-05)

Summary: Production security controls are largely not in place. Some app-level building blocks exist (OAuth callback, non-root container, pinned base image), but critical cloud controls (auth enforcement, headers, rate limiting, secrets) are missing.

Authentication & Authorization (CRI-001)
- OAuth integration: Implemented for Google and GitHub via Chainlit (`apps/chatbot/main.py`). Microsoft/enterprise SSO intentionally out of scope per requirements. Ensure `enable_oauth=true` in production config to enforce.
- RBAC: Out of scope by design; all authenticated users have the same role and access level. Personas affect UI behavior only.
- Session security: Partial. Cookie flags are framework-managed; `user_session_timeout` set to 15 days (config), not the 8-hour default in AC; no explicit refresh/revocation.

API Security & Rate Limiting (HIGH-001)
- Rate limiting: Planned via GCP infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Armor, API Gateway/LB). Not yet configured in repo.
- Abuse prevention: Partial. Input length is flagged (not enforced) by `InputSanitizer`; no request payload size limits; no cost monitoring; no circuit breaker.

HTTPS & Transport Security (HIGH-002)
- TLS/HTTPS: Cloud Run provides HTTPS by default, but GitHub Actions deploy uses `--allow-unauthenticated`; HSTS not configured; no certificate pinning.
- Security headers: Not implemented (no CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy set at app or edge).

Container & Infrastructure Security (MED-001)
- Container image: Implemented. Multi-stage, non-root user, SHA256-pinned base image in `apps/chatbot/Dockerfile`.
- Scanning: Not implemented. No Trivy/Snyk/Bandit step in `.github/workflows/deploy-chatbot.yml`.
- Infra hardening: Partial. Cloud Run used; service account specified, but least-privilege verification not documented; no explicit WAF/Cloud Armor or resource limits in IaC.

Secrets & Configuration Management
- Secret Manager: Implemented via GCP. Production secrets are supplied to Cloud Run from Google Secret Manager (injected as environment variables); code reads from env (`DB_PASSWORD`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- Rotation/audit: Not documented in repo; managed via GCP policies/process.

Monitoring & Audit Logging
- App logs: Implemented via Cloud Logging (standard). Security event monitoring, audit trail: Not implemented.

Acceptance Criteria Status
- CRI-001 (Auth/RBAC/Session): Partially met (OAuth implemented; RBAC intentionally out of scope; 8h timeout pending).
- HIGH-001 (Rate limiting/Abuse): Not met in code; planned via GCP infra.
- HIGH-002 (HTTPS/HSTS/Headers): Not met.
- MED-001 (Container/Infra): Partially met (image hardening).
- Secrets/Config: Met for Secret Manager usage; rotation/audit process not documented here.
- Monitoring/Audit: Not met.

Recommended Next Steps
- Enable and enforce OAuth in Chainlit config; add Microsoft/SSO as needed; introduce RBAC middleware for server actions.
- Add edge/app security headers (CSP, HSTS, XFO, XCTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) via Cloud Load Balancer header actions or ASGI middleware.
- Implement rate limiting (IP/user/API-key) and request size caps; add circuit breakers for external APIs.
- Integrate Google Secret Manager; remove raw secrets from env; plan rotation.
- Add CI steps for SAST/Trivy and policy checks; consider Cloud Armor/WAF.
