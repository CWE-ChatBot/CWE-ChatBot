# Story S-9: Cloud Production Security Implementation

**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Security & Compliance  
**Status**: Not Implemented (framework/infrastructure gaps)  

## Story

**As a** Security Team Member,  
**I want** to implement comprehensive security controls for the cloud production environment,  
**so that** the CWE ChatBot meets enterprise security standards and compliance requirements before public deployment.

## Background

The vulnerability assessment identified several critical security gaps that must be addressed before cloud production deployment. While the SQL injection vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated, authentication, HTTPS enforcement, and other production security measures remain incomplete.

**Assessment Source**: docs/stories/2.1/Vulnerability-Assessment-Report.md  
**Overall Security Rating**: B+ (83/100) - Production-ready with authentication implementation

## Implementation Review (2025-10-05)

Summary: Production security controls are largely not in place. Some app-level building blocks exist (OAuth callback, non-root container, pinned base image), but critical cloud controls (auth enforcement, headers, rate limiting, secrets) are missing.

Authentication & Authorization (CRI-001)
- OAuth integration: Implemented for Google and GitHub via Chainlit (`apps/chatbot/main.py`). Microsoft/enterprise SSO intentionally out of scope per requirements. Ensure `enable_oauth=true` in production config to enforce.
- RBAC: Not implemented; personas exist but no server-side role authorization or admin endpoints.
- Session security: Partial. Cookie flags are framework-managed; `user_session_timeout` set to 15 days (config), not the 8-hour default in AC; no explicit refresh/revocation.

API Security & Rate Limiting (HIGH-001)
- Rate limiting: Planned via GCP infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Armor, API Gateway/LB). Not yet configured in repo.
- Abuse prevention: Partial. Input length is flagged (not enforced) by `InputSanitizer`; no request payload size limits; no cost monitoring; no circuit breaker.

HTTPS & Transport Security (HIGH-002)
- TLS/HTTPS: Cloud Run provides HTTPS by default, but GitHub Actions deploy uses `--allow-unauthenticated`; HSTS not configured; no certificate pinning.
- Security headers: Not implemented (no CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy set at app or edge).

Container & Infrastructure Security (MED-001)
- Container image: Implemented. Multi-stage, non-root user, SHA256-pinned base image in `apps/chatbot/Dockerfile`.
- Scanning: Not implemented. No Trivy/Snyk/Bandit step in `.github/workflows/deploy-chatbot.yml`.
- Infra hardening: Partial. Cloud Run used; service account specified, but least-privilege verification not documented; no explicit WAF/Cloud Armor or resource limits in IaC.

Secrets & Configuration Management
- Secret Manager: Implemented via GCP. Production secrets are supplied to Cloud Run from Google Secret Manager (injected as environment variables); code reads from env (`DB_PASSWORD`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- Rotation/audit: Not documented in repo; managed via GCP policies/process.

Monitoring & Audit Logging
- App logs: Implemented via Cloud Logging (standard). Security event monitoring, audit trail: Not implemented.

Acceptance Criteria Status
- CRI-001 (Auth/RBAC/Session): Partially met (OAuth: Google/GitHub implemented; RBAC + 8h timeout pending).
- HIGH-001 (Rate limiting/Abuse): Not met in code; planned via GCP infra.
- HIGH-002 (HTTPS/HSTS/Headers): Not met.
- MED-001 (Container/Infra): Partially met (image hardening).
- Secrets/Config: Met for Secret Manager usage; rotation/audit process not documented here.
- Monitoring/Audit: Not met.

Recommended Next Steps
- Enable and enforce OAuth in Chainlit config; add Microsoft/SSO as needed; introduce RBAC middleware for server actions.
- Add edge/app security headers (CSP, HSTS, XFO, XCTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) via Cloud Load Balancer header actions or ASGI middleware.
- Implement rate limiting (IP/user/API-key) and request size caps; add circuit breakers for external APIs.
- Integrate Google Secret Manager; remove raw secrets from env; plan rotation.
- Add CI steps for SAST/Trivy and policy checks; consider Cloud Armor/WAF.
