# Story S-8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** Data Engineer,
**I want** to verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process,
**so that** the application's core knowledge base (RAG Memory) cannot be poisoned with malicious information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.
2.  [cite_start]If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data[cite: 1392].
3.  If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.
4.  The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.
5.  [cite_start]**New:** All retrieved CWE data is validated against an expected schema before being processed for embedding to prevent storing corrupted or malformed data in the vector database[cite: 637].

## Security Requirements
1.  **Prevent Memory Poisoning:** The RAG knowledge base is a form of long-term memory. [cite_start]The system must have controls to prevent an attacker from corrupting this memory with false or malicious information[cite: 193].
2.  **Secure Supply Chain:** The data pipeline for the CWE corpus is a critical part of our software supply chain and must be secured against tampering.

## Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] **Task 1: Secure Data Download** (AC: 1)
-   [ ] **Task 2: Implement Integrity Validation** (AC: 2, 3)
-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Schema Validation** (AC: 5)
    -   [ ] Define a schema (e.g., Pydantic model) that represents a valid CWE entry.
    -   [ ] After parsing the downloaded file, validate each entry against this schema before it is sent for embedding.
-   [ ] **Task 4: Isolate the Ingestion Service** (AC: 4)
    -   [ ] Review the IAM roles and network policies for the data ingestion service to ensure it has no unnecessary permissions.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **`T1 (Memory Poisoning)`**: This is the primary threat mitigated by this story. [cite_start]By validating the source data's integrity, we prevent the RAG's long-term memory from being corrupted[cite: 193].
    * `T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)`: The original threat name, which is a specific form of Memory Poisoning.

## Testing
### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create a test that attempts to run the ingestion pipeline with a corrupted or schema-invalid data file and verify that the process aborts and logs a critical error.
