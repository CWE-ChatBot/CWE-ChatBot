# Story S-8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** Data Engineer,
**I want** to verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process,
**so that** the application's core knowledge base cannot be poisoned with malicious information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.
2.  If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data.
3.  If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.
4.  The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * `T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)`: Addressed by verifying the integrity and authenticity of the source data before it enters our system.
