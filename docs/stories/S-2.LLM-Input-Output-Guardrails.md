# Story S-2: Enforce LLM I/O Guardrails with Google Cloud Services

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Vertex AI Migration Implemented, Model Armor Ready
**Outcome:** App migrated to Vertex AI with adapter pattern; Model Armor scripts ready to deploy
**Note:** Any Infrastructure-as-Code work is deferred to **S-11.Infrastructure-as-CodeTF.md**.
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-06
**Key Achievement:** Updated VertexProvider with async support + safety settings; migration is now a simple env var change
**Migration Guide:** Set `LLM_PROVIDER=vertex`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=cwechatbot`, `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION=us-central1`


## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,
**I want** Google Cloud‚Äìmanaged protections on all LLM inputs/outputs,
**so that** prompt injection, jailbreaks, sensitive-data leaks, and unsafe content are prevented without bespoke code.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Model Armor policies** are applied to every prompt/response on the serving path (Vertex AI / Gemini endpoints) to detect & block prompt injection, jailbreaks, data-loss attempts, malicious URLs, and unsafe content; blocked events return a generic error to the user and are logged. ([Google Cloud][1])
2. **Vertex AI Safety & content filters** are enabled with documented thresholds for harassment, hate, sexual, and dangerous content; thresholds are version-controlled and auditable. ([Google Cloud][2])
3. **Structured output** is enforced via **responseSchema** (JSON) and/or **Function Calling** (OpenAPI schema) so tool args are constrained; non-conforming output is rejected or auto-fixed by the platform. ([Google AI for Developers][3])
4. **Sensitive Data Protection (DLP)** is used to inspect and (where configured) mask/redact sensitive fields in prompts *before* model invocation and in model outputs *before* display/logging. Policy covers at least emails, phone numbers, government IDs, and payment data. ([Google Cloud][4])
5. **Auditability:** Cloud **Audit Logs** for Vertex AI ‚ÄúData Access‚Äù are enabled; Cloud **Logging** captures allow/deny decisions from Model Armor/Safety filters, with a centralized **CRITICAL** severity for blocks and a redacted payload snapshot. ([Google Cloud][5])
6. **Grounding/quality (optional, if used):** When grounding is enabled, it uses **Vertex AI Search** and/or **Google Search grounding** to reduce hallucinations; configuration is documented. ([Google Cloud][6])
7. **Runbooks:** An ops runbook describes how to change thresholds/policies, view/triage blocked events, and roll back safely.

## Security Requirements

1. **Secure LLM Boundary (managed):** All LLM I/O must traverse Model Armor + Safety Filters + (optional) DLP pipelines; direct calls to the model without these controls are prohibited by policy and IaC. ([Google Cloud][1])
2. **Defense in Depth:** Input screening (Model Armor + DLP) and output screening (Safety filters + Model Armor + DLP) are both active; disabling one fails deployment checks. ([Google Cloud][1])

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **T1: Wire Model Armor on serve path** (AC: 1, 2) - ‚ùå BLOCKED (App uses Gemini API SDK, not Vertex AI)

  * [ ] Enable Model Armor for the project/region used by Vertex AI endpoints; apply recommended "Prompt Injection/Jailbreak/Data Loss/URL/Offense" shields. ([Google Cloud][1])
  * [ ] Set failure behavior: **block + generic error**; emit structured log (policy, reason, hash of payload).
  * **Script Created:** [scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh) (archived - requires Vertex AI migration)
  * **Blocker:** App uses `google.generativeai` SDK which calls `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, not Vertex AI endpoints

* [x] **T2: Configure Vertex AI Safety filters** (AC: 2) - DOCUMENTED

  * [x] Set category thresholds per product policy; check in config to repo with environment overlays (dev/stage/prod). ([Google Cloud][2])
  * **Implementation:** SafetySetting already configured in app code (BLOCK_NONE for security content)
  * **Documentation:** [docs/runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md](../runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md)

* [ ] **T3: Enforce structured output** (AC: 3) - DEFERRED

  * [ ] For pure responses, set `responseSchema` to force JSON; for tools, use **Function Calling** with OpenAPI-compatible schemas; enable "forced function calling" where applicable. ([Google AI for Developers][3])
  * **Note:** Deferred to future story - requires app code changes to request parameters

* [ ] **T4: Sensitive-data inspection/redaction** (AC: 4) - ‚ùå BLOCKED (Requires Vertex AI + Model Armor)

  * [ ] Create DLP inspection templates & de-identification (masking/redaction) templates; apply on request path pre-model and on response path pre-UI/log. ([Google Cloud][4])
  * **Blocker:** Model Armor DLP shield requires Vertex AI (app uses Gemini API SDK)
  * **Current Protection:** Input sanitization at app level only
  * **Note:** Full DLP templates also deferred - requires app code changes for inline redaction

* [ ] **T5: Observability & Audit** (AC: 5) - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (App logs work, Vertex AI logs N/A)

  * [ ] Enable **Data Access** audit logs for Vertex AI; route Model Armor/Safety/DLP decisions to Cloud Logging with log-based metrics and alerting (PagerDuty/Email) on **CRITICAL** blocks. ([Google Cloud][5])
  * **Script Created:** [scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh) (archived - targets Vertex AI logs)
  * **What Works:** Application-level logging via `get_secure_logger()`
  * **What Doesn't:** Vertex AI Data Access logs (app doesn't use Vertex AI)

* [x] **T6: Grounding config (optional)** (AC: 6) - DOCUMENTED (Already Implemented via RAG)

  * [x] If enabled, document Vertex AI Search sources and/or Google Search grounding flags; verify citations/metadata return. ([Google Cloud][6])
  * **Implementation:** RAG with pgvector already provides grounding (7,913 CWE chunks)
  * **Note:** Vertex AI Search grounding not needed - RAG already prevents hallucination
  * **Documentation:** [docs/runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md](../runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md#grounding-and-quality)

* [ ] **T7: IaC & Policy Guard** - DEFERRED TO S-11

  * [ ] Terraform/Blueprints enforce that endpoints are created with Safety/Model-Armor/DLP configs; a policy validator blocks drift.
  * **Note:** Explicitly deferred to S-11.Infrastructure-as-CodeTF.md per story requirements

* [x] **T8: Runbooks & SOPs** (AC: 7) - COMPLETE

  * [x] Create operator SOP for threshold tuning, incident response, and rollback.
  * **Implementation:**
    - Operations runbook: [docs/runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md](../runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md)
    - SafetySetting documentation: [docs/runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md](../runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md)
    - Smoke test script: [scripts/s2_smoke_test.py](../../scripts/s2_smoke_test.py)

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented (No App Code Changes)

This story was implemented following the **no-code-change** approach from the implementation plan. All guardrail enforcement is handled via:

1. **Setup Scripts** (ready to run):
   - [scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh) - Creates Model Armor template with shields
   - [scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh) - Sets up logging, metrics, and alerts

2. **Documentation** (complete):
   - [docs/runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md](../runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md) - Operations runbook for incident response
   - [docs/runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md](../runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md) - SafetySetting configuration details

3. **Testing** (smoke test ready):
   - [scripts/s2_smoke_test.py](../../scripts/s2_smoke_test.py) - Black-box testing of guardrail effectiveness

### Acceptance Criteria Status (HONEST ASSESSMENT)

| AC | Description | Original Status | Reality Check | Notes |
|----|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| AC-1 | Model Armor policies | ‚úÖ READY | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | App uses Gemini API SDK (not Vertex AI) - Model Armor N/A |
| AC-2 | Safety filters documented | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | BLOCK_NONE thresholds documented, actually works |
| AC-3 | Structured output | ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFERRED | ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEFERRED** | Correctly deferred - requires app code changes |
| AC-4 | DLP inspection/redaction | üü° PARTIAL | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | Model Armor DLP requires Vertex AI |
| AC-5 | Auditability | ‚úÖ READY | üü° **PARTIAL** | App logging works; Vertex AI logs N/A |
| AC-6 | Grounding | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | RAG grounding works independently |
| AC-7 | Runbooks | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | üü° **PARTIAL** | SafetySetting docs useful; Model Armor docs premature |

**Summary:** 2/7 fully complete (AC-2, AC-6), 2/7 partial (AC-5, AC-7), 1/7 deferred (AC-3), 2/7 blocked (AC-1, AC-4)

**Critical Finding:** Story assumed Vertex AI integration. App actually uses Gemini API SDK. Model Armor cannot be applied without migrating to Vertex AI first (requires app code changes, violating "no-code-change" constraint).

### What Actually Works (Deploy These)

**SafetySetting Configuration** - ‚úÖ ALREADY DEPLOYED
- Configuration: [apps/chatbot/src/llm_provider.py](../../apps/chatbot/src/llm_provider.py#L47-L51)
- Documentation: [docs/runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md](../runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md)
- Status: BLOCK_NONE for all categories (intentional for security content)
- No action needed - already in production

**Input Sanitization** - ‚úÖ ALREADY DEPLOYED
- Implementation: [apps/chatbot/src/input_security.py](../../apps/chatbot/src/input_security.py)
- Features: Control character removal, length limits, SQL injection prevention
- No action needed - already in production

**RAG Grounding** - ‚úÖ ALREADY DEPLOYED
- Implementation: pgvector + halfvec with 7,913 CWE chunks
- Prevents hallucination by constraining responses to CWE corpus
- No action needed - already in production

### What's Blocked (Cannot Deploy)

**Model Armor Setup** - ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Script: [scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_model_armor.sh)
- Blocker: Requires Vertex AI endpoints (app uses Gemini API SDK)
- Action: Archive script to `docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/`

**Vertex AI Observability** - ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Script: [scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh](../../scripts/s2_setup_observability.sh)
- Blocker: Targets Vertex AI audit logs (app doesn't use Vertex AI)
- Action: Archive script to `docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/`

**Model Armor Runbook** - ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Document: [docs/runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md](../runbooks/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md)
- Blocker: Documents Model Armor operations (not applicable to Gemini API SDK)
- Action: Archive to `docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/`

### What's Deferred (Future Work)

- **AC-3 (Structured output)**: Requires `responseSchema` or function calling in app request parameters
- **T7 (IaC)**: Explicitly deferred to S-11.Infrastructure-as-CodeTF.md

### Recommended Next Steps

**Option A: Accept Current State** (Low effort, Medium risk)
1. Document current 3-layer defense (app security, RAG, SafetySetting)
2. Accept medium-high risk for prompt injection attacks
3. Archive Vertex AI scripts for future migration
4. Close S-2 as "Partially Complete"

**Option B: Add App-Level Prompt Injection Detection** (Medium effort, Low risk)
1. Create new story: "S-2B: App-Level Prompt Injection Detection"
2. Add regex-based detection to `InputSanitizer`
3. Test with known attack payloads (use s2_smoke_test.py patterns)
4. Deploy without Vertex AI migration

**Option C: Migrate to Vertex AI** (High effort, Low risk)
1. Create epic: "Vertex AI Migration"
2. Update `LLMProvider` to use `vertexai` SDK instead of `google.generativeai`
3. Deploy Model Armor, observability, and all S-2 deliverables
4. Full platform-level protection achieved

**Recommendation:** Option B (app-level detection) provides best balance of effort vs risk improvement.

## Dev Notes

* **Why this change:** Google Cloud **Model Armor** provides managed shields for prompt injection/jailbreak/data-loss and unsafe content across prompts *and* responses, reducing bespoke code and keeping protections current. ([Google Cloud][1])
* **Structured output:** Prefer **responseSchema** (strict JSON) or **Function Calling** with schemas to reduce free-form text and hallucinated tool calls. ([Google AI for Developers][3])
* **DLP:** Use inspection + masking templates to keep secrets/PII out of prompts, responses, and logs. ([Google Cloud][4])
* **Bot abuse:** Consider **reCAPTCHA Enterprise** at chat entry points to reduce automated attacks (optional). ([Google Cloud][7])

## Testing

### Automated

* [ ] **Shield E2E tests:** Replay a corpus of known jailbreak/injection strings; assert **Model Armor blocked** and user received a generic error; verify CRITICAL log present. ([Google Cloud][1])
* [ ] **Safety thresholds:** Generate test content across categories; assert pass/fail matches configured thresholds. ([Google Cloud][2])
* [ ] **Schema adherence:** Send prompts that try to elicit non-JSON or wrong schema; assert platform returns structured output or fails closed. ([Google AI for Developers][3])
* [ ] **DLP redaction:** Seed PII/secret tokens in prompts/responses; assert masked/redacted before model/UI/logs. ([Google Cloud][4])
* [ ] **Audit:** Validate Vertex AI **Data Access** logs present for sampled calls. ([Google Cloud][5])

### Manual

* [ ] In UI, attempt prompt injection / system-prompt extraction; verify block + CRITICAL log with reason code. ([Google Cloud][1])
* [ ] Toggle thresholds in non-prod and confirm effect via test prompts. ([Google Cloud][2])
