add an update at top to docs/plans/S12.web_protect/S12-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md and docs/plans/S12.web_protect/PERFECT-SCORES-ACHIEVED.md we need to add a note that we had to revert the changes to remove unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline because Chainlit needs them. This lowers the scores.

Content Security Policy (CSP)
−20 Failed
Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely. This includes 'unsafe-inline' or data: inside script-src, overly broad sources such as https: inside object-src or script-src, or not restricting the sources for object-src or script-src.

Remove unsafe-inline and data: from script-src, overly broad sources from object-src and script-src, and ensure object-src and script-src are set.

redo the tests with unsafe and update
