# Story 4.1: Production Cloud Infrastructure Setup and Configuration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** DevOps administrator and system operator,
**I want** a complete production cloud infrastructure with OAuth authentication, environment configuration, and database setup,
**so that** the CWE ChatBot can be deployed securely in production with proper user management and operational controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** Google Cloud Platform production infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform including Cloud Run, Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Cloud Storage, and IAM configurations.
2. **AC2:** OAuth 2.0 authentication is fully configured with Google and GitHub providers, supporting both individual users and enterprise domain restrictions.
3. **AC3:** Production database includes all required tables (users, conversations, messages) with proper indexes, constraints, and security policies.
4. **AC4:** Environment variable management is implemented using Google Secret Manager with secure access patterns and rotation capabilities.
5. **AC5:** Production monitoring, logging, and alerting are configured for system health, security events, and performance metrics.

## Security Requirements
1. **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 with MFA support; service account authentication for internal services; IAM-based access controls.
2. **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with user, admin, and service roles; domain-based access restrictions for enterprise deployments.
3. **Input Validation:** All configuration inputs validated; environment variables sanitized; SQL injection prevention in all queries.
4. **Data Protection:** Encryption at rest and in transit; PII anonymization; secure secret management with rotation policies.
5. **Compliance:** GDPR compliance with data export/deletion; audit logging for all administrative actions; data retention policies.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the foundational production setup story that enables all subsequent development. It establishes the core infrastructure, security model, and operational capabilities needed for enterprise deployment.

### Data Models
**Users Table Extensions** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]:
- `preferences`: JSONB field for flexible user settings (response verbosity, persona defaults, privacy preferences)
- `oauth_provider_type`: 'google' | 'github' for provider tracking
- `oauth_provider_user_id`: External provider user identifier
- `role`: 'user' | 'admin' | 'governance' for access control
- `domain_restriction`: Optional domain validation for enterprise deployments

### API Specifications
**OAuth Endpoints** [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]:
- GET /auth/login/{provider} - Initiate OAuth flow
- GET /auth/callback/{provider} - Handle OAuth callback
- POST /auth/logout - Terminate user session
- GET /auth/user - Get current user information

### Component Specifications
**Infrastructure Components** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Google Cloud Run for containerized application hosting
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 14.x for structured data storage
- Google Secret Manager for secure configuration management
- Cloud Storage for file uploads and export storage
- Google Cloud Armor for WAF and DDoS protection

**Authentication Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]:
- Chainlit OAuth hooks for seamless provider integration
- Session management with secure HTTP-only cookies
- JWT tokens for API authentication with configurable expiration

### File Locations
**Infrastructure Code** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `infrastructure/terraform/` - Complete Terraform configurations
- `apps/chatbot/src/auth/` - OAuth and session management
- `apps/chatbot/src/config/` - Environment and configuration management
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions

**Database Setup**:
- `apps/cwe_ingestion/` - CWE data ingestion pipeline
- `apps/chatbot/src/db.py` - Database connection module

### Technical Constraints
**Cloud Infrastructure Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Google Cloud Platform with specific regional deployment for compliance
- PostgreSQL 14.x with pgvector extension for CWE embeddings
- Redis 6.x for session caching and rate limiting

**Security and Compliance Constraints**:
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication flows
- GDPR compliance with data export and deletion capabilities
- SOC 2 Type II controls for enterprise customers
- Encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data

**Database Connection Management**:
- Connection pooling mandatory for multi-user production environment
- CWEQueryHandler must use psycopg[pool] or equivalent connection pooling
- Per-request connection acquisition/release pattern to prevent concurrency issues
- No single long-lived database connections in production deployment

### Testing Requirements
**Infrastructure Testing**:
- Terraform plan validation and resource drift detection
- Database migration testing with rollback procedures
- OAuth flow testing with multiple providers and edge cases
- Load testing for autoscaling and performance validation

### Threat Considerations
**Attack Surfaces**:

- API endpoints without proper rate limiting and input validation
- Administrative interfaces with elevated privilege escalation risks

**Threat Scenarios**:
- OAuth token theft and session hijacking attacks
- SQL injection through administrative interfaces and policy management
- Privilege escalation from regular user to administrative access
- Data exfiltration through misconfigured access controls

**Required Security Controls**:
- OAuth state parameter validation and PKCE implementation
- Parameterized queries and input sanitization for all database operations
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Comprehensive audit logging for all administrative and data access operations

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Incident response procedures with defined escalation paths
- Security monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities

### Testing Standards
**Production Readiness Testing**:
- Integration tests for OAuth flows with real provider endpoints
- Database performance testing under production load scenarios
- Security testing including OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Disaster recovery testing with backup restoration and failover procedures
