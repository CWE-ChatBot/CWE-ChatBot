# Story 4.3: Ephemeral Document Ingestion (EDI) – PDF & Text Processing (Cloud Functions v2 + Infra Rate Limiting)

## Status

Ready for implementation

## Story

**As a** cybersecurity professional using the CWE ChatBot,
**I want** to upload PDF and text files for ephemeral processing without persistence,
**so that** I can incorporate their content into my CWE-related queries without compromising data security or creating storage liabilities.

## Scope Notes

* **Serverless & Ephemeral:** The PDF processing backend is implemented as **Cloud Functions (2nd gen)** (ephemeral, stateless). Chainlit remains on Cloud Run.
* **Out of scope:** OCR for scanned/image-only PDFs.
* **Single-file flow:** One file per request/turn.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

1. **AC1: Upload & Type Validation**

   * Chainlit UI accepts **one** file per request with a hard limit of **10 MB**.
   * File type is determined via **content sniffing** (magic bytes/printable ratio); filename extensions are ignored.
   * If magic starts with `%PDF-`, treat as PDF; else treat as text-like.
   * Mismatched/malicious content is rejected with a stable error code + friendly message.

2. **AC2: PDF Isolation & Sanitization (Cloud Functions v2 Worker)**

   * PDF processing occurs **only** in an isolated **Cloud Functions (2nd gen) PDF Worker**, not publicly accessible.
   * Worker validates **PDF magic bytes** and rejects non-PDF payloads even if `Content-Type` is `application/pdf`.
   * Worker **rejects** encrypted/password-protected and image-only PDFs (no OCR) with specific error codes.
   * Worker removes `/OpenAction`, `/AA`, JavaScript name trees, **XFA** from `/AcroForm`, and **embedded files**; guardrails against abnormal object graphs are enforced.
   * Text is extracted using secure parsing libs with **max 50 pages** and a **60s** processing timeout.

3. **AC3: Text File Handling (Local, In-Memory)**

   * Local validation in Chainlit using content sniffing:

     * Reject NUL bytes.
     * UTF‑8 decode (strict); if fails, use a single fallback detector; strict decoding thereafter.
     * Enforce **printable ratio ≥ 0.9** (allow `\n`, `\r`, `\t`).
     * Optionally reject pathologically long single lines (> 2 MB/line).
   * Processing is **memory-only**; no disk writes in Chainlit container.

4. **AC4: Ephemerality & Truncation**

   * All file bytes and derived text are **discarded after use** (request scope only).
   * Extracted text is truncated **per file** to **1,000,000 Unicode code points**; UI shows `[truncated]` marker if clipped.

5. **AC5: Service-to-Service AuthN/Z (OIDC + IAM)**

   * Chainlit obtains a **Google‑signed OIDC ID token** from the metadata server with **audience = Worker URL**.
   * Cloud Functions verifies token (signature/expiry/audience) and **IAM** authorizes caller with **`roles/cloudfunctions.invoker`** granted **only** to the Chainlit service account.
   * Worker is deployed with **internal ingress** (not public) so only authorized GCP callers can invoke it.
   * (Optional) Worker performs explicit `aud` claim validation for defense-in-depth.

6. **AC6: Resource Limits & Safe Defaults**

   * Worker (Cloud Functions v2) runtime: **1 vCPU**, **512Mi**, **60s** timeout, non-root, read-only root filesystem (may use `/tmp`).
   * Chainlit client timeout ≤ **55s**; single retry on transient **5xx** with jittered backoff; no retries on 4xx.
   * Oversized uploads, page-limit breaches, and timeouts return stable error codes.

7. **AC7: Error Taxonomy & UX**

   * Stable error codes → friendly messages, including: `too_large`, `too_many_pages`, `timeout`, `invalid_content_type`, `pdf_magic_missing`, `encrypted_pdf_unsupported`, `image_only_pdf_unsupported`, `binary_text_rejected`, `decoding_failed`, `auth_failed`, `aud_mismatch`.

8. **AC8: Observability (No Content Logging)**

   * Structured logs contain **metadata only** (request size, duration, page count, status, error code, request ID).
   * SLOs: **p50 < 2s**, **p95 < 5s**, **p99 < 10s**; non-4xx error rate < **1%**.
   * RED metrics exported per service.

9. **AC9: Rate Limiting / Abuse Protections (Infrastructure-Managed)**

   * External rate limiting enforced via **Cloud Armor** on the HTTPS Load Balancer in front of Chainlit (Cloud Run).
   * Default policy: **20 uploads/min per IP**, optional session-header keying (e.g., `x-session-key`).
   * Cloud Armor returns `429`; Chainlit surfaces `rate_limited` message.
   * The PDF Worker (Cloud Functions v2) is **not public** and **not externally rate-limited**.

10. **AC10: Prompt-Safety Integration**

    * Treat extracted text as **untrusted**; prompts use delimitering and disable document-controlled tool invocation.

## Security Requirements

1. **Authentication:** OIDC ID tokens minted by metadata server with audience bound to the function URL; platform verifies token.
2. **Authorization:** Chainlit SA has `roles/cloudfunctions.invoker` only for the Worker; Worker SA has minimal permissions (logging only).
3. **Input Validation:** PDF magic-byte validation; strict `Content-Type`; page/size/time/object-guard limits; text printable ratio & NUL checks; encoding policy.
4. **Data Protection:** No persistence; memory-only in Chainlit; Worker may use `/tmp` only; **no payload logging**; per-file 1,000,000-char cap.
5. **Compliance & Hardening:** Non-root, read-only filesystem, minimal base images pinned by digest; no token caching; HTTP client disallows redirects; audit logs are metadata-only.
6. **Infra Rate Limiting:** Cloud Armor at the edge; Worker not public.
7. **Security Model Summary:** IAM defines *who* can invoke; OIDC defines *how* identity is proven; Cloud Functions (v2) enforces both together.
