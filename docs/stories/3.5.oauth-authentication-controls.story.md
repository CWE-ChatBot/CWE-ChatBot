# Story 3.5: OAuth 2.0 Authentication Controls via Chainlit Hooks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** cybersecurity professional,
**I want** to authenticate securely using OAuth 2.0 through Chainlit's authentication system,
**so that** I can access the CWE chatbot with proper identity verification and session management without managing passwords.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** The system implements OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect authentication via Chainlit hooks, supporting both Google and GitHub OAuth provider integration (NFR34), **verifiable through local authentication flow testing with both providers.**

2. **AC2:** User authentication is enforced at the earliest point in the request lifecycle using Chainlit decorators and authentication hooks, preventing access to the chatbot interface without valid authentication (NFR33), **verifiable by attempting to access the application without authentication.**

3. **AC3:** The system manages user sessions using secure token-based authentication (JWTs from OAuth provider), ensuring proper session lifecycle management including login, session validation, and logout (NFR34), **verifiable through session timeout and token validation testing.**

4. **AC4:** User profile information from the OAuth provider (name, email, avatar) is properly retrieved and stored securely in the user session for personalization and role assignment (FR4), **verifiable through profile display testing.**

5. **AC5:** The authentication system integrates with the persona system to support different user roles (PSIRT, Developer, Academic Researcher, etc.) with proper role assignment and storage for response personalization - note that all authenticated users have the same access policy (FR4), **verifiable through role assignment and persona selection testing.**

6. **AC6:** All authentication flows handle errors gracefully, providing clear feedback for authentication failures, expired tokens, or provider unavailability (NFR26), **verifiable through error scenario testing.**

7. **AC7:** The system properly handles OAuth callbacks and redirects, maintaining user experience continuity while ensuring security best practices (NFR4), **verifiable through OAuth flow completion testing.**

## Security Requirements

1. **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect implementation using Google and GitHub OAuth providers with secure token handling and validation
2. **Authorization:** Role/persona assignment integrated with OAuth user profile for response personalization (all authenticated users have same access policy)
3. **Session Security:** Secure JWT-based session management with proper token validation, expiration handling, and secure storage
4. **Data Protection:** User profile information encrypted in session storage with PII handling compliance (GDPR)
5. **Redirect Security:** Secure OAuth callback handling with state validation and redirect URI whitelisting
6. **Token Management:** Secure storage and handling of OAuth tokens with proper refresh token rotation
7. **Error Security:** Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive authentication details in logs or user messages

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

**Attack Surfaces**:
- OAuth callback endpoints vulnerable to redirect attacks and CSRF
- JWT token handling and validation susceptible to token-based attacks
- Session storage vulnerable to session hijacking and fixation
- User profile data exposure through improper PII handling

**Threat Scenarios**:
- **OAuth Redirect Attacks**: Malicious actors craft redirect URIs to capture authorization codes or tokens
- **Token-Based Attacks**: JWT token tampering, replay attacks, or exposure of signing keys
- **Session Attacks**: Session hijacking through XSS or network interception
- **Profile Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to user profile information or role escalation

**Required Security Controls**:
- OAuth state parameter validation and secure redirect URI whitelisting
- JWT token signing verification and proper expiration handling
- Secure session storage with encryption and proper lifecycle management
- PII protection with GDPR compliance for user profile data

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Implement OAuth security best practices with state validation and secure callbacks
- Use secure JWT handling with proper signing algorithms and token validation
- Deploy comprehensive session security with encryption and secure storage
- Enforce strict access controls and role-based authorization
