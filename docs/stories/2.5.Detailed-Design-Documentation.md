# Story 2.5: Comprehensive Detailed Design Documentation

**Epic**: Documentation and Knowledge Management  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 12 story points  
**Sprint**: 2.5

## Overview
Create a comprehensive detailed design document that consolidates implementation-specific details from existing code with user stories and plans into a unified technical specification. This document will serve as both current implementation documentation and future development guidance, focusing on the "how" of implementation rather than the "what" of architecture.

## Business Justification
- **Developer Onboarding**: Reduce time for new team members to understand implementation details
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture institutional knowledge about algorithms, patterns, and decisions
- **Development Velocity**: Provide concrete implementation guidance for future features
- **Code Maintenance**: Enable effective debugging and optimization with detailed system understanding
- **Technical Debt Management**: Document current implementation decisions and trade-offs

## Current State Analysis
The project has comprehensive high-level architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`) and detailed user stories (`docs/stories/`), but lacks implementation-focused detailed design documentation:

**Existing Assets:**
- High-level architectural overview with C4 diagrams
- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Working implementation code in `apps/chatbot/src/`
- Comprehensive security and integration tests
- Implementation planning documents

**Documentation Gaps:**
- Algorithm specifications and step-by-step implementation details
- Data structure definitions with validation rules and transformation logic
- Security implementation specifics (MED-006/MED-007 detailed mechanics)
- Performance optimization techniques and resource management
- Integration patterns and communication protocols
- Testing strategies and mock implementation details

## Target Deliverable
A comprehensive `docs/detailed-design.md` document that bridges the gap between high-level architecture and actual code implementation, providing developers with concrete technical specifications.
