Better Leverage Chainlit Features
You've requested to use more Chainlit features. The current implementation uses slash commands (/ask, /compare) for the CWE Analyzer, but Chainlit's native Action buttons are a better fit.

Refactoring Opportunity
Problem: Manually parsing chat commands is less user-friendly and requires more custom code than using built-in UI elements. Your comments indicate you explicitly removed actions in favor of slash commands, but actions are better suited for this use case.

Solution: Use cl.Action to guide the user after an analysis.

## 1. Code to Remove from ConversationManager
The new @cl.on_action handler in main.py completely replaces the need for your ConversationManager to manually parse slash commands like /ask and /compare. You must remove that old logic.

File: src/conversation.py

You should delete the block of code inside process_user_message_streaming that looks like this:

❌ Code to DELETE:
Python

# In process_user_message_streaming...

            # ...
            # Analyzer disambiguation (action-driven): support persistent modes and switching commands
            if context.persona == "CWE Analyzer":
                import re as _re
                # Command switches: /ask, /compare, /exit
                if _re.match(r"^\s*/ask\b", message_content, flags=_re.IGNORECASE):
                    context.analyzer_mode = "question"
                    out_msg = cl.Message(content="Question mode activated...")
                    await out_msg.send()
                    return { ... } # This entire block should be removed.

                if _re.match(r"^\s*/compare\b", message_content, flags=_re.IGNORECASE):
                    context.analyzer_mode = "compare"
                    out_msg = cl.Message(content="Comparison mode activated...")
                    await out_msg.send()
                    return { ... } # This entire block should be removed.
            # ...
✅ Code to KEEP:
You can keep the logic for the /exit command, as it provides a useful way for users to manually leave a special mode.

Python

# In process_user_message_streaming...

        # This is still useful and should be kept.
        if context.analyzer_mode and message_content.strip().lower() == '/exit':
            context.analyzer_mode = None
            set_user_context(context) 
            await cl.Message(content="Exited follow-up mode.").send()
            return { "response": "Exited follow-up mode.", ... }
## 2. The Complete main.py (or app.py) File
This is the most important part. Your main application file becomes the central point for handling all user interactions and UI events. The code from the previous plan has been combined here into a single, complete example that you can hand to your developer.

File: app.py (or main.py)

Python

import chainlit as cl
from src.config import config
from src.conversation import ConversationManager
from src.user_context import UserPersona
from src.ui.profiles import create_chat_profiles
from src.utils.session import get_user_context, set_user_context

# --- 1. Initialization ---
# Initialize the manager once when the application starts.
# It holds the connections and models needed for the session.
conversation_manager = ConversationManager(
    database_url=f"postgresql://{config.pg_user}:{config.pg_password}@{config.pg_host}:{config.pg_port}/{config.pg_database}",
    gemini_api_key=config.gemini_api_key
)

# --- 2. Chat Profile Setup ---
# This sets up the persona selection dropdown on the welcome screen.
@cl.oauth_callback
def oauth_callback(
  provider_id: str,
  token: str,
  raw_user_data: dict,
  default_user: cl.User,
) -> cl.User | None:
    # This is an example, customize as needed
    return default_user

@cl.set_chat_profiles
async def chat_profile():
    return create_chat_profiles()

# --- 3. Chat Start Logic ---
# This function runs every time a new user starts a chat.
@cl.on_chat_start
async def on_chat_start():
    # Initialize the user context in the session
    context = get_user_context()
    
    # Set the persona from the selected chat profile
    profile_name = cl.user_session.get("chat_profile")
    if profile_name and UserPersona.is_valid_persona(profile_name):
        context.persona = profile_name
        set_user_context(context)

    await cl.Message(
        content=f"Hello! I am your CWE Chatbot, currently in **{context.persona}** mode. How can I assist you today?"
    ).send()

# --- 4. Main Message Handler ---
# This function runs for every message the user sends.
@cl.on_message
async def on_message(message: cl.Message):
    # It delegates all the complex logic to the ConversationManager.
    result = await conversation_manager.process_user_message_streaming(
        session_id=cl.user_session.get("id"), # Use a unique session ID
        message_content=message.content,
        message_id=getattr(message, 'id', None)
    )

    # After the response is sent, check if we need to display action buttons.
    context = get_user_context()
    if context.persona == "CWE Analyzer" and not context.analyzer_mode:
        actions = [
            cl.Action(name="ask_question", value="ask", label="❓ Ask a Question"),
            cl.Action(name="compare_cwes", value="compare", label="⚖️ Compare CWEs")
        ]
        await cl.Message(
            content="Next steps for this analysis:", 
            actions=actions, 
            author="System"
        ).send()

# --- 5. Action Button Handler ---
# This dedicated function runs ONLY when a user clicks an action button.
@cl.on_action
async def on_action(action: cl.Action):
    """Handles all action button clicks."""
    # 1. FETCH the context from the session
    context = get_user_context()

    if action.value == "ask":
        # 2. MODIFY the context object
        context.analyzer_mode = "question"
        await cl.Message(content="**Question mode activated.** Ask a follow-up about the analysis.").send()
    
    elif action.value == "compare":
        # 2. MODIFY the context object
        context.analyzer_mode = "compare"
        await cl.Message(content="**Comparison mode activated.** Provide CWE IDs to compare.").send()

    # 3. SAVE the modified context back to the session. THIS IS CRITICAL.
    set_user_context(context)
## 3. Key Concepts for the Developer
Separation of Concerns: The app.py file is now the UI Controller. It handles events from the user (on_message, on_action). The conversation.py file is the Business Logic Controller. It orchestrates the process of generating a response but doesn't deal with UI buttons. This separation makes the code much easier to test and debug.

The Action Flow: The flow is now event-driven:

@cl.on_message runs and generates a response.

At the end, it sends a separate message with the action buttons.

The app then waits. Nothing happens until the user clicks a button.

When a button is clicked, @cl.on_action runs, changes the state (analyzer_mode), and saves it.

The next time the user sends a message, @cl.on_message will run again, and the ConversationManager will see the new analyzer_mode in the context and behave differently.
