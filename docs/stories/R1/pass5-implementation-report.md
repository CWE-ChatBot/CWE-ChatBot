# R1 Pass 5 — Implementation Report

## Summary

- Removed the legacy session manager and rely solely on Chainlit’s `cl.user_session` with small helpers.
- Fixed direct-CWE routing in `QueryProcessor` by routing on a unified analysis dict and added a follow‑up fallback using `last_cwes`.
- Standardized generation logic so personas only affect tone/format; capabilities are uniform.
- Simplified ingestion imports to prefer a clean package path, with a safe legacy fallback.
- Trimmed unused modules and reduced duplication in app startup and settings.
- All unit and integration tests pass locally.

## Implemented

- Session manager removal
  - Deleted `UserContextManager` class from `apps/chatbot/src/user_context.py`.
  - `ConversationManager.__init__` signature simplified to `(database_url, gemini_api_key)` and no longer accepts a `context_manager`.
  - State remains in `cl.user_session` via `src/utils/session.py`.

- QueryProcessor fixes & follow‑ups
  - `preprocess_query()` now assembles an `analysis` dict and then derives `search_strategy`/`boost_factors` from it.
  - `_determine_search_strategy()` and `_calculate_boost_factors()` now accept the unified analysis dict (so `has_direct_cwe` is honored).
  - `process_with_context()` falls back to the most recent CWE in `last_cwes` if `current_cwe` is missing.

- Uniform generation policy
  - Removed persona‑based conditional branches from `ResponseGenerator` (no special casing for any persona in logic).
  - Left `_format_cve_creator()` only as a compatibility helper for existing tests; it is not auto‑invoked by logic.

- Ingestion import simplification
  - `apps/chatbot/src/query_handler.py` now prefers `from cwe_ingestion import ...`.
  - Retains a minimal fallback to `CWE_INGESTION_PATH` for environments not yet packaged.

- Dead code removal
  - Deleted `apps/chatbot/src/processing/embedding_service.py` (unused).
  - Deleted `apps/chatbot/src/prompts/role_templates.py` (no longer referenced by generator).

- Chainlit persona as the single source of truth
  - `UISettings` no longer includes `persona`.
  - `on_chat_start` seeds persona strictly from `chat_profile`; `on_settings_update` acknowledges settings changes (detail level, examples, mitigations) without mutating persona.
  - Logging now reads persona from the session/UserContext rather than settings.

## Files Changed

- Updated
  - `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`: constructor simplified; continues using `get_user_context()`; unified core path already in place from pass4.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/processing/query_processor.py`: analysis dict routing; helpers updated; follow‑up last_cwes fallback.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`: removed persona conditionals; retained `_format_cve_creator` for tests.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/query_handler.py`: package‑first imports; minimal legacy fallback.
  - `apps/chatbot/main.py`: persona from `chat_profile`; settings panel sans persona; logging adjusted.
- Removed
  - `apps/chatbot/src/processing/embedding_service.py`
  - `apps/chatbot/src/prompts/role_templates.py`
  - `UserContextManager` class from `apps/chatbot/src/user_context.py`

## Tests

- Unit: PASSED
  - `pytest -q apps/chatbot/tests/unit`
  - Includes the previously added “evidence injected for all personas” test.
- Integration: PASSED
  - `pytest -q apps/chatbot/tests/integration`
  - Kept `_format_cve_creator()` for compatibility with an existing formatting test.
- UI/Playwright: Not executed in this report. Use TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE to install browsers and run E2E flows if needed.

## Notes & Follow‑ups

- Packaging ingestion as an installable `cwe_ingestion` package will allow removal of the legacy fallback from `query_handler.py` entirely.
- Optional: expand tests for QueryProcessor follow‑up behavior using `last_cwes` fallback.
- Personas remain for tone/section emphasis only; functionality and evidence handling are uniform across roles.
