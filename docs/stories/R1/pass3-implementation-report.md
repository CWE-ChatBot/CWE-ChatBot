# R1 Pass 3 — P0, P1, P2 Implementation Report

This report documents all changes implemented across P0 (fix now), P1 (simplify & native), and P2 (quality & ops) items, with rationale, impacted files, and validation summary.

## Summary

- Addressed the routing/KeyError bug and hardened prompt/data handling (P0).
- Unified the LLM stack behind a single provider adapter and removed the old demo (P1).
- Polished configurability, logging, and added unit tests for sensitive paths (P2).
- All integration tests pass; E2E non‑DB tests pass/skip as designed; retrieval_full remains gated by DB env/data.

## P0 — Fix Now (Correctness & Security)

1) QueryProcessor.preprocess_query: missing key
- What: `enhance_query_for_search` didn’t return `has_direct_cwe`; computed locally and included `enhanced_query` in the result.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/processing/query_processor.py`
- Why: Prevent KeyError and correct strategy routing.
- Validation: Added `test_query_processor_preprocess.py`; ensures direct CWE → `direct_lookup`.

2) Evidence ingestion for all personas (do not paste raw file text)
- What: Store uploaded file text in session as `uploaded_file_context` and inject it as a low‑weight pseudo‑chunk for every persona (not just CVE Creator). The pseudo‑chunk has:
  - `metadata.cwe_id = "EVIDENCE"`, `metadata.section = "Evidence"`, `metadata.name = "Uploaded Evidence"`
  - `scores.hybrid = 0.01` (low weight)
  - Wrapped with `<<FILE_CONTEXT_START>> ... <<FILE_CONTEXT_END>>` delimiters
  - If retrieval returns nothing but evidence exists, we generate using evidence alone (both streaming and non‑streaming paths).
- Files: `apps/chatbot/main.py`, `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`, `apps/chatbot/src/file_processor.py`
- Why: Treat file content as untrusted data (prompt‑injection resistance) while still allowing the LLM to reference it across personas (Developer, PSIRT, etc.).
- Validation: E2E upload path runs; UI shows a side “Uploaded Evidence” element; evidence is cleared after use.

3) Unify model provider and configuration
- What: Introduced provider adapter; removed Vertex demo; selection via single `PROVIDER` env.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/llm_provider.py`, `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`, removed `apps/chatbot/examples/main_simple.py`
- Why: Single code path → simpler config/testing.
- Validation: Integration + E2E pass; provider default “google”.

4) SecurityValidator over‑blocks useful content
- What: Mask potential sensitive information (IP/email/API tokens/CC) instead of blocking; mark with `sensitive_information_masked` and slight confidence drop.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/input_security.py`
- Why: Reduce false positives while staying safe.
- Validation: Existing tests continue to pass.

5) config.validate_config tolerant in offline/dev
- What: `validate_config(offline_ai=…)` only requires GEMINI_API_KEY when not offline.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/config.py`, `apps/chatbot/main.py` (offline flag already threaded)
- Why: Allow CI/dev to run when AI is disabled.
- Validation: Integration start paths verified.

6) Clamp RAG context size by characters
- What: Cap built context to ~16k characters instead of slicing parts.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`
- Why: Keep prompt size bounded; reduce model truncation.
- Validation: E2E/streaming works; no regressions.

7) Explicit Gemini safety settings
- What: Set permissive, explicit safety settings for security content; pass to generation calls.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`
- Why: Avoid over‑filtering infosec examples while staying explicit.
- Validation: Streaming/non‑stream calls behave as expected.

## P1 — Simplify & Make It “Chainlit‑Native”

8) Consolidate persona handling
- What: Removed `RoleManager`; personas are controlled via header Chat Profiles + `ui_settings`. RoleManager tests are skipped with a clear message.
- Files: removed `apps/chatbot/src/user/role_manager.py`; updated `apps/chatbot/tests/test_role_manager.py`, `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/test_role_manager.py`
- Why: Single source of truth; fewer code paths and less session state to sync.

9) One message path only (streaming)
- What: Primary message handling is streaming; kept minimal non‑stream helper for compatibility (no user‑facing path).
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`
- Why: Smaller surface area; consistent UX.

10) Use Chainlit elements for sources & file evidence consistently
- What: Added an “Uploaded Evidence” side element mirroring source cards; truncate display; clear context after use. Evidence pseudo‑source (`EVIDENCE`) is excluded from CWE source cards.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/main.py`
- Why: Better UX; keeps model prompt clean and consistent.

11) LLM prompt injection handling: prefer isolation over mutation
- What: Stopped removing separators/code fences in `role_templates`; isolate untrusted content with strong delimiters (already done for file context/RAG).
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/prompts/role_templates.py`
- Why: Avoid damaging legitimate text (e.g., ``` fences, ---) while keeping isolation.

12) Replace custom analytics with Chainlit’s built‑ins where possible
- What: Continued relying on Chainlit history; kept only minimal counters in session. (No extra code added; confirmed approach)
- Files: n/a (validation of approach)

## P2 — Quality, Maintainability, and Ops

13) Small correctness nits
- What: If RoleManager existed, its clear API would be changed; since removed, not applicable. Seed persona immediately from `ui_settings` on context creation.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`
- Why: Cleaner initial state; fewer flickers at start.

14) Config & weights
- What: Accept very small float drift for RRF (1e‑6). Made section boost factor configurable via `SECTION_BOOST_VALUE`.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/config.py`, `apps/chatbot/src/query_handler.py`
- Why: Config centralization; predictable behavior across envs.

15) Logging
- What: Production logs now include a `session_hash` (hashed) and optional `request_id` when provided, without leaking sensitive fields.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/src/security/secure_logging.py`
- Why: Better traceability while maintaining security posture.

16) Tests
- What: Added unit tests for:
  - `InputSanitizer`: ignores injection inside fenced code blocks.
  - `QueryProcessor.preprocess_query`: direct CWE path returns `direct_lookup`.
  - `FileProcessor`: size/type gating messages.
- Files: `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/test_input_sanitizer_code_block.py`, `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/test_query_processor_preprocess.py`, `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/test_file_processor_limits.py`
- Why: Guard rails for critical behaviors.

### Evidence Types and Limits (applies across personas)
- File types supported: PDF, text/plain, text/markdown, application/json
- Size: up to 10 MB (PDF pages capped to 30)
- Security: never merged into the prompt; always isolated as a pseudo‑chunk with low weight

## Provider Selection (One Knob)

- Single env `PROVIDER=google|vertex` controls the backend (default: `google`).
- Removed legacy/alternate knobs; simplified help text in `run_local_full.sh`.

## Test Results

- Integration: 7 passed
  - `poetry run pytest apps/chatbot/tests/integration -q`
- E2E (excluding `retrieval_full`): passes/skips as expected
  - `poetry run pytest apps/chatbot/tests/e2e -q -k 'not retrieval_full'`
- `retrieval_full` remains gated by DB env/data (set POSTGRES_* and ingest to run these).

## Next Steps (Optional)

- If desired, consolidate persona control fully into ChatSettings (remove header profiles) for a single UI entry point.
- Add a provider unit test asserting `PROVIDER` precedence and error messaging on unsupported values.
- Consider token‑based context caps (tiktoken) for more precise control than character counts.
