# R1 Pass 7 — Implementation Report

## Summary

- Adopted a streaming-only architecture: all responses are generated and delivered via the streaming path.
- Persona is sourced exclusively from Chainlit’s ChatProfile (top-bar), not settings.
- Simplified LLM safety handling by removing custom safety dict wiring (uses provider defaults) to avoid SDK shape issues.
- Lazy-imported the PDF library to prevent module import errors in environments without PDFs.
- All unit and integration tests pass.

## Implemented

- Streaming-only
  - `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`: removed `process_user_message` (non-stream). The streaming method now handles sanitize → retrieve → stream tokens → finalize and validate → optional mask/update.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`: removed `generate_response` and `_clean_response`. `generate_response_streaming` is the single generation path; callers stream tokens and then validate the final text.

- Persona source of truth
  - `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`: `_get_or_create_user_context` seeds persona from `chat_profile` (header) instead of settings.
  - `apps/chatbot/main.py`: on message, ensures persona matches `chat_profile`; removed reliance on `ui_settings['persona']` and fixed undefined persona references in logs by using `UserPersona.DEVELOPER.value` as fallback.

- Gemini SDK safety settings
  - `apps/chatbot/src/llm_provider.py`: removed passing custom `safety_settings` to `generate_content_async`; defaults apply. Avoids passing unexpected structures to the SDK.

- Lazy PDF import
  - `apps/chatbot/src/file_processor.py`: moved `PyPDF2` import into `_extract_pdf_content` to avoid import-time failures in environments not handling PDFs.

## Files Changed

- Updated
  - `apps/chatbot/src/conversation.py`: removed non-stream method; streaming path remains primary.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`: removed non-stream method and `_clean_response`; streaming generator is the only path.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/llm_provider.py`: simplified safety config usage.
  - `apps/chatbot/src/file_processor.py`: lazy `PyPDF2` import.
  - `apps/chatbot/main.py`: persona follows `chat_profile`; logging uses safe fallback.

## Validation

- Unit tests: PASSED
  - `pytest -q apps/chatbot/tests/unit`
- Integration tests: PASSED
  - `pytest -q apps/chatbot/tests/integration`

## Notes & Next Steps

- Healthcheck: Chainlit does not expose `/health` by default. If you need a health endpoint, front Chainlit with a proxy exposing `/health` or use a sidecar check (e.g., DB connectivity).
- If you want to enable explicit Gemini safety settings, I can wire the official `SafetySetting` list in the provider with a known-good shape.
