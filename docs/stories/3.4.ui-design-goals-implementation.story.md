## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** UX designer and developer,
**I want** to implement the comprehensive User Interface Design Goals from the PRD,
**so that** the CWE ChatBot provides an intuitive, accessible, and professionally branded conversational interface that enhances user experience across all cybersecurity professional roles.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Overall UX Vision Implementation
1. **AC1:** The conversational interface provides an intuitive and efficient experience that feels like interacting with a knowledgeable expert rather than a rigid database, **verifiable through user experience testing and interface inspection.**
2. **AC2:** Users feel empowered to find answers quickly and confidently with minimal friction, **verifiable through task completion time measurements and user satisfaction surveys.**

### Key Interaction Paradigms
3. **AC3:** The primary interaction is via a Chainlit chat window supporting natural language input and output with responsive design, **verifiable through cross-device testing.**
4. **AC4:** Progressive disclosure is implemented starting with concise answers and offering deeper dives upon request to avoid overwhelming users, **verifiable through UI interaction testing.**
5. **AC5:** The UI subtly adapts and displays indicators based on user roles (PSIRT, Developer, Academic, Bug Bounty, Product Manager) to tailor information presentation, **verifiable by testing role-specific UI adaptations.**
6. **AC6:** Clear and immediate feedback is provided for user actions, system processing states, and confidence levels of responses, **verifiable through interaction flow testing.**

### Core Screens and Views Implementation
7. **AC7:** The main chat interface serves as the central conversational window with optimized input/output handling, including Input Bar, Message Bubbles, and Chat Action Buttons, **verifiable through functional testing.**
8. **AC8:** A settings/profile page is implemented with secondary navigation for User Preferences, Auth/API Key Management, and Chat History Export, **verifiable through page navigation and functionality testing.**
9. **AC9:** A feedback/report issue module is integrated within the chat interface using dedicated modal/form components for structured feedback submission, **verifiable through feedback submission testing.**
10. **AC10:** An onboarding/introduction screen provides guided tour with interactive components explaining ChatBot capabilities and interaction best practices, **verifiable through new user workflow testing.**

### User Flow Implementation
11. **AC11:** Basic CWE Query & Response flow is implemented with proper error handling for unrecognized queries, no relevant CWE found, and LLM API errors, **verifiable through query flow testing.**
12. **AC12:** Role-Based Information Retrieval flow supports role recognition, clarification prompting, and mid-session role changes, **verifiable through role-based workflow testing.**
13. **AC13:** Ambiguous/Insufficient Input handling flow provides clear feedback and refinement guidance with graceful disengagement for repeated ambiguity, **verifiable through ambiguous input testing.**
14. **AC14:** Security guardrails and logging are integrated at every interaction stage with input validation, output validation, and comprehensive audit trails, **verifiable through security flow testing.**

### Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
15. **AC15:** All interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard navigation, **verifiable through keyboard-only testing.**
16. **AC16:** Color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum standards for text and graphical elements, **verifiable through accessibility auditing tools.**
17. **AC17:** Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are implemented for screen reader compatibility, **verifiable through screen reader testing.**
18. **AC18:** Content remains readable when text is scaled up to 200%, **verifiable through browser zoom testing.**

### Professional Branding Implementation
19. **AC19:** The visual identity aligns with professional, clean, and trustworthy aesthetic evoking confidence and reliability, **verifiable through design review and user perception testing.**
20. **AC20:** The official CWE/CVE-inspired color palette is implemented with proper usage guidelines, **verifiable through design system validation.**
