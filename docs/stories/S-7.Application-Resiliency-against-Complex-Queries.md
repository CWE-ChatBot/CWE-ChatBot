# Story S-7: Implement Application Resiliency against Complex Queries

**Status**: Not Implemented (partial safeguards present)

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to implement strict timeouts and complexity limits on AI-driven queries,
**so that** a single malicious user cannot degrade service performance for all legitimate users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A hard timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) is implemented for the entire RAG and LLM response generation process.
2.  Any query exceeding the timeout is terminated gracefully, the event is logged, and a user-friendly error message is returned.
3.  A pre-processing mechanism is implemented to analyze query complexity (e.g., based on length or token count) and reject queries that are excessively large before they are sent to the LLM.
4.  The timeout and complexity limit values are configurable via environment variables.
5.  Automated tests are created to prove that overly long-running or complex queries are correctly terminated or rejected.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * `D-1 (Resource Exhaustion via Complex AI Queries)`: Addressed by proactive complexity checks and hard timeouts.

### Implementation Review (2025-10-05)

- Current code does not implement a hard end-to-end timeout around retrieval + LLM:
  - No `asyncio.wait_for(...)` or equivalent timeout wrapper in `ConversationManager`, `ProcessingPipeline`, `CWEQueryHandler`, or `LLMProvider`.
- Graceful timeout handling is therefore not present (no specific user-facing timeout message/log hook).
- Query complexity safeguards exist but do not enforce rejection:
  - `InputSanitizer` flags `excessive_length` (>2000 chars) but does not block; `SECURITY_MODE=BLOCK` only blocks prompt/command injection, not length.
  - `Config` exposes limits such as `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH`, `MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, `MAX_DOCUMENT_SNIPPET_LENGTH`, etc., but there is no enforcement to reject inputs exceeding `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` before LLM.
- Environment configurability is partially present (length/context caps), but there are no timeout env vars defined (e.g., `QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`).
- No automated tests specific to S-7 behaviors (timeout/complexity rejection) were found.

Acceptance status summary:
- AC1 (hard timeout): ❌ Not implemented
- AC2 (graceful timeout handling): ❌ Not implemented
- AC3 (pre-process and reject large/complex queries): ❌ Not implemented (flags only)
- AC4 (configurable via env): ⚠ Partial (length/context vars exist; no timeout vars)
- AC5 (automated tests): ❌ Not implemented
