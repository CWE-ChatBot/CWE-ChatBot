# Story S-7: Implement Application Resiliency against Complex Queries

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to implement strict timeouts and complexity limits on AI-driven queries,
**so that** a single malicious user cannot degrade service performance for all legitimate users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A hard timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) is implemented for the entire RAG and LLM response generation process.
2.  Any query exceeding the timeout is terminated gracefully, the event is logged, and a user-friendly error message is returned.
3.  A pre-processing mechanism is implemented to analyze query complexity (e.g., based on length or token count) and reject queries that are excessively large before they are sent to the LLM.
4.  The timeout and complexity limit values are configurable via environment variables.
5.  Automated tests are created to prove that overly long-running or complex queries are correctly terminated or rejected.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * `D-1 (Resource Exhaustion via Complex AI Queries)`: Addressed by proactive complexity checks and hard timeouts.
