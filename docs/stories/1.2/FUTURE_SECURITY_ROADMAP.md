## Implementation Strategy Options

### **Option 1: Security-First Approach** ⭐ *Recommended*
- **Approach**: Implement Security Stories S-1 through S-8 systematically
- **Benefits**: Comprehensive security foundation before feature development
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for complete security implementation
- **Risk**: Delayed feature delivery but reduced security debt

### **Option 2: Feature-First Approach**
- **Approach**: Move to Story 1.3 (CWE Data Ingestion) immediately
- **Benefits**: Faster feature delivery and user value
- **Timeline**: Features in 2-3 weeks, security enhancements later
- **Risk**: Potential security gaps during feature development

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach** ⚡ *Balanced*
- **Approach**: Implement Critical Priority items (1-2) immediately, then Story 1.3
- **Benefits**: Addresses most critical security gaps while maintaining feature velocity
- **Timeline**: 1 week security, then feature development
- **Risk**: Medium security gaps but manageable with monitoring

## Resource Requirements and Dependencies

### **Technical Resources Needed**
- **Security expertise**: Container security, cloud security, authentication systems
- **Development time**: 1-6 weeks depending on approach
- **Cloud services**: Additional GCP services (Security Command Center, Secret Manager, Cloud Armor)
- **Third-party tools**: Vulnerability scanners, security monitoring tools

### **Dependencies**
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Cloud Run deployment (✅ Complete)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow (✅ Complete)
- **Monitoring Foundation**: Basic Cloud Run monitoring (✅ Complete)
- **Access Control**: IAM-based authentication (✅ Complete)

### **Budget Considerations**
- **Critical Priority (1-2)**: Minimal cost (mostly configuration)
- **High Priority (3-5)**: Low-Medium cost (Cloud Armor, Secret Manager, monitoring)
- **Medium Priority (6-7)**: Medium cost (development time, enterprise tooling)

## Risk Assessment

### **Risks of Delaying Implementation**
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Without vulnerability scanning, unknown vulnerabilities may exist
- **Application-Layer Attacks**: No WAF protection against common web attacks
- **Credential Exposure**: Secrets in environment variables pose security risk
- **Incident Response**: No formal procedures may lead to prolonged security incidents

### **Risks of Immediate Implementation**
- **Feature Delivery Delay**: Security-first approach delays user-facing features
- **Complexity Introduction**: Additional security tooling increases system complexity
- **Performance Impact**: WAF and monitoring may introduce latency
