- No error pages or stack traces exposed
- Application responds appropriately to requests
- Security-hardened configuration active

## Security Improvements Validated in Production

### ‚úÖ **Container Runtime Security** - CONFIRMED ACTIVE

1. **Non-Root User Execution**
   - Container runs as `appuser:1000` (verified through Cloud Run logs)
   - No privilege escalation attempts possible
   - Shell access disabled (`/bin/false`)

2. **File Permission Security**
   - Application files: `644` (read-only for security)
   - Log directory: `750` (restricted access)
   - Health check: `755` (executable but secure)

3. **Environment Security Variables**
   ```dockerfile
   ENV PYTHONHASHSEED=random      # ‚úÖ Active - Prevents hash attacks
       MALLOC_CHECK_=2            # ‚úÖ Active - Memory corruption detection
       PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1  # ‚úÖ Active - No .pyc files
   ```

### ‚úÖ **Secure Health Check Implementation** - OPERATIONAL

**Health Check Validation:**
```python
# healthcheck.py - Executing safely in production
def main():
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8080/health', timeout=5):
            # ‚úÖ No command injection possible
            # ‚úÖ Safe URL handling
            # ‚úÖ Proper timeout handling
```

**Health Check Results:**
- Executes every 30 seconds as configured
- No command injection vectors present
- Proper error handling for all failure scenarios
- Timeout protection prevents hanging processes

### ‚úÖ **Supply Chain Security** - ENHANCED

**Multi-Stage Build Benefits Confirmed:**
- Build tools (gcc, make, etc.) absent from production image
- Only runtime dependencies present in final container
- Reduced attack surface verified through image analysis
- Production image optimized for security and performance

## Updated Security Analysis Results

### **NIST SSDF Compliance** - ENHANCED
- **PW.4 (Secure Coding)**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - Validated in production
- **PW.6 (Code Review)**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - End-to-end testing completed
- **RV.1 (Vulnerability Detection)**: ‚úÖ **READY** - Deployment pipeline validated

### **OWASP Container Security Top 10** - UPDATED STATUS
| Requirement | Status | Production Validation |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| C01: Container Image Vulnerabilities | ‚úÖ | Multi-stage build active, minimal attack surface |
| C02: Supply Chain Attacks | ‚úÖ | Build process verified, ready for digest pinning |
| C03: Overprivileged Containers | ‚úÖ | Non-root execution confirmed in Cloud Run |
