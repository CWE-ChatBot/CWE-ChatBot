# Story S-5: Harden Session and Authentication Flow

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,
**I want** to implement standard security best practices for session management and the OAuth 2.0 flow,
**so that** user accounts are protected from hijacking and impersonation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  All session cookies are configured with the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags to protect against theft.
2.  A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented on all web responses to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that could lead to token theft.
3.  The OAuth 2.0 implementation strictly validates that the `redirect_uri` in any incoming request exactly matches one of the URIs in a pre-configured server-side allow-list.
4.  The OAuth 2.0 `state` parameter is cryptographically generated, used, and validated on every authorization request to prevent CSRF on the login flow.
5.  Automated tests are created to verify the presence of secure cookie flags, the CSP header, and the correct rejection of invalid `redirect_uri` values.

## Security Requirements

1.  **Session Security:** The application must protect session tokens from common client-side attacks like XSS and CSRF.
2.  **OAuth 2.0 Best Practices:** The OAuth flow must adhere to current security best practices (RFC 6819) to prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Task 1: Configure Secure Cookie Flags** (AC: 1)
-   [ ] **Task 2: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** (AC: 2)
-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Strict `redirect_uri` Validation** (AC: 3)
-   [ ] **Task 4: Implement and Validate OAuth `state` Parameter** (AC: 4)
-   [ ] **Task 5: Write Security Integration Tests** (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * `S-1 (User Session Hijacking)`: Mitigated by secure cookie flags and a strict CSP.
    * `S-2 (OAuth Flow Interception)`: Mitigated by `redirect_uri` validation and the `state` parameter.

## Testing

### Manual Verification
-   [ ] Use browser developer tools to inspect the application's cookies and verify the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags are present.
-   [ ] Inspect the response headers to verify a `Content-Security-Policy` header is present and correctly configured.
