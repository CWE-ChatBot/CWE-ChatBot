here’s a crisp, developer-ready review of your story + plan, with concrete fixes and call-outs.

executive verdict

Strong plan overall, but a few spec/impl mismatches and scope footguns will bite you in delivery/security reviews. Biggest items:

AC3 “never leaves the domain” conflicts with using external LLM/embedding APIs unless you force on-prem or use a no-egress mode.

RBAC vs. evidence uploads: your Security Requirements say role-gated uploads, but the design (and earlier change set) enables uploads for all personas. Pick one.

“Virus scanning” and GCS encryption are listed as done, but not reflected in the code changes you’ve shared. Either downgrade to “planned” or wire the scanner/storage now.

Confidence scoring & follow-ups: good direction; needs type-stable return shapes, feature flags, and test oracles to avoid regressions.

Similar CWE discovery via regex on free text will be noisy; prefer first-class relationship data.

Below are the must-fix blockers, then per-AC notes, security gaps, and a tightened implementation order.

ship blockers (fix these before merging)

Data egress (AC3 vs architecture)

If you use Gemini/OpenAI embeddings or generation in prod, user content does leave the domain. Mitigations:

Option A (preferred): add a config flag DATA_EGRESS_MODE = {"none","embeddings_only","full"}. Enforce at runtime: block outbound calls when none, allow only embeddings when embeddings_only, etc.

Option B: run self-hosted models (e.g., local embedding + on-prem LLM) for compliant environments and document that AC3 only holds in that mode.

RBAC consistency for file uploads

Security spec says “Role-based access control to file upload features,” but your acceptance criteria + UX say everyone can attach evidence. Decide:

Decision 1: Keep uploads enabled for all personas (recommended) → update Security Requirements to “role may influence processing, not permission.”

Decision 2: Gate uploads → implement a simple policy: UPLOAD_ALLOWED_PERSONAS = {"PSIRT","Developer","CVE Creator","CWE Analyzer"} and show a disabled state + hint for others.

Evidence isolation is claimed; ensure it’s enforced

Your plan says isolation via cl.user_session and pseudo-chunk injection. Good. Add two guards:

Assert that no prompt builder concatenates uploaded_file_context to the user prompt (search for “Attached File Content” patterns and remove).

After response generation, clear the evidence: cl.user_session.set("uploaded_file_context", None) to prevent cross-turn bleed. (The plan claims it’s already there; double-check it truly runs after generation in both streaming/non-streaming paths.)

Virus scanning & storage encryption

The plan cites virus scanning, GCS encryption, JSONB encryption. The code you shared doesn’t implement them. Either:

Move them to “Phase 0 infra” and reduce AC2/AC3 wording to “scaffolding present,” or

Wire a scanner interface now (e.g., Scanner.scan(bytes)->ScanResult with a no-op local impl + ClamAV adapter behind a feature flag). Fail fast on result.infected=True.

For storage, if you don’t actually upload to GCS yet, remove it from AC verifiability and keep files ephemeral in memory until implemented.

Similar CWE retrieval quality

Regex over “relationship” chunks is brittle. Prefer:

Store normalized relationships (ParentOf/ChildOf/RelatedTo) during ingestion and query them by cwe_id.

If not available, at least scope regex to the “Relationships”/“Taxonomy Mappings” sections and de-dupe by a canonical CWE-###.

Confidence score UX + semantics

Define the contract: score ∈ [0,1], level ∈ {Very Low, Low, Medium, High}, include top contributing factors for debugging (top_signals). Gate display behind CONFIDENCE_DISPLAY_ENABLED.

Add golden tests (fixed queries → expected band) so the threshold doesn’t flap when embeddings change.

acceptance criteria – pass/fail & tweaks

AC1, AC5: ✅ Reasonable. Add a single source of truth for limits:

TEXT_MAX_CHARS, FILES_MAX_MB, FILES_MAX_COUNT, PDF_MAX_PAGES. Emit helpful user-facing errors.

AC2: ⚠️ Partially true as written. Mark virus scanning and GCS storage as planned unless you wire them now.

AC3: ❌ as written if any external API is called with user content. Address via egress modes (see Blocker #1) and update the acceptance text to: “When configured to no-egress mode, user data does not leave the deployment boundary.”

AC4: ✅ with a caveat. You promise optional cross-session preservation; specify a retention policy + user control (toggle in settings, “Clear context”).

AC6: ⚠️ Your enrichment code builds “comprehensive_metadata” by re-grouping chunks on the fly. It works, but is compute-heavy and order-dependent. Better:

Precompute during ingestion or first hit → cache in Redis keyed by CWE-###.

AC7: ✅ directionally, but regex follow-up detection will have false positives. Keep it conservative and fall back to normal retrieval if unsure. Add FOLLOWUP_ENABLED flag.

AC8: ⚠️ “Fact verification” is non-trivial. Scope v1 to source-anchored snippets:

When emitting a fact, also attach the supporting chunk id and show a small “From CWE-###: <section>” note. Treat this as provenance, not true verification.

AC9: ⚠️ Implement but with relationship data, not free-text regex when possible (see Blocker #5).

AC10: ✅ Solid. Ensure you store full_response server-side only and do not echo evidence verbatim in the “details” path.

AC11/12: ✅ Already strong. Keep persona templates minimal and avoid duplicating the entire system prompt per role; use delta snippets.

AC13: ⚠️ Good safeguards in InputSanitizer. Add an LLM output guard that drops tool-calling instructions or URL beacons if they appear in generated text.

AC14/15: ✅ with the UX gating and golden tests noted above.

security review (pragmatic)

Prompt injection: You delimit evidence (<<FILE_CONTEXT_START>>). Good. Also strip \x00–\x1f control chars and neutralize markdown autolinks in evidence ([text](javascript:...) → plain text).

CSRF: Using Chainlit web sockets—CSRF is largely irrelevant; remove CSRF testing from scope, keep Origin checks and auth.

Session isolation: Add an automated test that spawns two sessions and asserts uploaded_file_context never appears cross-session.

PII masking: Don’t commit until you have a concrete policy. At minimum, redact obvious secrets in logs (AKIA, xoxp-, -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----).

Security headers: Out of scope if Chainlit fronts the app; document which headers the reverse proxy sets (HSTS, COEP/CORP are nice to have).

implementation tightening (types, flags, contracts)

Typed chunk model

@dataclass
class Chunk:
    document: str
    metadata: dict  # {cwe_id:str, name:str, section:str}
    scores: dict    # {hybrid: float}


QueryHandler contract

class QueryResult(TypedDict):
    chunks: list[Chunk]
    confidence_score: float
    confidence_level: Literal["Very Low","Low","Medium","High"]
    similar_cwes: list[dict]  # optional


Feature flags (env)

CONFIDENCE_DISPLAY_ENABLED=true
FOLLOWUP_ENABLED=true
DATA_EGRESS_MODE=embeddings_only
SIMILAR_CWE_MODE=relationships   # or "regex"


Post-gen cleanup
Ensure both code paths do:

finally:
    cl.user_session.set("uploaded_file_context", None)

testing gaps you should add

Evidence isolation test: Assert the raw file text never appears in the user prompt sent to the model; only as a retrieved chunk.

Low-confidence flow: Two tests anchored to corpus fixtures—one yields <0.4 with suggestions rendered; one yields ≥0.8 and bypasses the suggestions.

Similar CWE precision: Golden set where CWE-79 → {CWE-80,CWE-116, …} and assert membership (not order).

Progressive disclosure: Playwright test that clicks “Show More Details” and verifies the exact details block, not a second copy of the summary.

Follow-up intent: Negative tests (e.g., “thanks” or “what about lunch?”) must not trigger follow-up mode.

timeline & sequencing (leaner + safer)

Phase 0 (½ day): Feature flags, evidence cleanup, type contracts, golden tests skeleton.

Phase 1 (1 day): Comprehensive CWE retrieval (+ cache), similar CWE via relationships, confidence scoring (with display gated).

Phase 2 (½–1 day): Follow-up detection (conservative), progressive disclosure UI.

Phase 3 (½ day): Low-confidence suggestions, persona deltas, provenance snippets.

Phase 4 (deferred): Virus scanning + GCS storage, PII masking beyond secrets, cross-session persistence.

PR checklist (copy into the PR)

 Evidence never concatenated to prompts; injected only as low-weight EVIDENCE chunk

 Evidence cleared from session after generation (all code paths)

 DATA_EGRESS_MODE enforced with tests

 Confidence score contract + display behind flag; golden tests added

 Similar CWE uses relationships (or regex gated by flag)

 Follow-up detection conservative; fallback safe

 Progressive disclosure stores details server-side; no evidence echoing

 Secrets redaction in logs; control-char stripping from evidence

 New unit + e2e tests passing; pydantic/typing added where relevant

small code nits (quick wins)

Use Enum for persona names to avoid stringly-typed bugs.

Limit AskFileMessage to max_files=3, max_size_mb=10 (you already do), and reject zero-byte files.

For confidence score, expose contributing factors in debug logs: {"avg_similarity":..., "result_count":..., ...}.

Cache comprehensive CWE metadata by CWE-### with a short TTL (e.g., 1h) to keep p95 sane.
