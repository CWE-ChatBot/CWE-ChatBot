# Story 2.4: Enterprise AI Security Enhancement with Google Model Armor and Llama Guard

**Epic**: Security Infrastructure Enhancement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 8 story points  
**Sprint**: 2.4

## Overview
Replace the current custom input sanitization system with enterprise-grade AI security solutions to provide more robust protection against prompt injection, jailbreaking, and content safety violations. This enhancement will integrate Google Cloud's Model Armor and Meta's Llama Guard to establish defense-in-depth for AI security.

## Business Justification
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Move from rule-based sanitization to AI-powered threat detection
- **Industry Best Practices**: Adopt proven enterprise AI security solutions from Google Cloud and Meta
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet emerging AI safety regulations with certified security controls
- **False Positive Reduction**: Reduce legitimate query blocking with more sophisticated content analysis
- **Scalable Protection**: Handle evolving attack patterns without manual rule updates

## Current State Analysis
The existing input sanitization system (`InputSanitizer` in `src/security/input_sanitizer.py`) uses:
- Regex-based pattern matching for injection detection
- Static rule sets for malicious content identification
- Limited context understanding for legitimate vs malicious intent
- Manual maintenance required for new attack patterns

**Limitations of Current Approach:**
- High false positive rate for legitimate security queries
- Cannot adapt to new prompt injection techniques automatically
- Limited understanding of semantic context
- No protection against sophisticated jailbreaking attempts
