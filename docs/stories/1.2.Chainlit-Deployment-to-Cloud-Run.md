# Story 1.2: Basic Chainlit Application Deployment to Cloud Run

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Story

**As an** administrator,
**I want** a basic Chainlit "Hello World" application deployed to Google Cloud Run,
**so that** we can validate our core deployment pipeline and infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A minimal Chainlit application is created within the `apps/chatbot` directory, configured to respond with a simple greeting (e.g., "Hello, welcome to CWE ChatBot!").
2.  The Chainlit application can be successfully containerized using a `Dockerfile` and built into a Docker image.
3.  A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build) is configured to automatically build the Docker image and deploy it to GCP Cloud Run upon changes to the `apps/chatbot` directory.
4.  The deployed Chainlit application is accessible via a public URL, and its basic functionality can be verified via a simple HTTP request or browser interaction from a local machine.
5.  Basic application logs from the Chainlit app (e.g., startup messages) are visible and accessible in Google Cloud Logging, and can also be accessed locally during development.

## Security Requirements

1.  **Least Privilege Service Account:** The Cloud Run service MUST be deployed using a dedicated GCP Service Account with only the minimal permissions required to run the application (e.g., no broad project-level roles).
2.  **Secure Base Image:** The `Dockerfile` MUST use a minimal, official, and secure Python base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`).
3.  **Secure Ingress:** The Cloud Run service ingress MUST be configured to "Allow internal traffic and traffic from Cloud Load Balancing" initially, not "Allow all traffic", to prevent direct public exposure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [x] **Task 1: Create Minimal Chainlit Application** (AC: 1, 5)
    -   [x] In `apps/chatbot/`, create a `main.py` file with a basic Chainlit "Hello World" app.
    -   [x] Add a `requirements.txt` file specifying `chainlit` and any other initial dependencies.
-   [x] **Task 2: Containerize the Application** (AC: 2, Security: 2)
    -   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` in the `apps/chatbot/` directory.
    -   [x] Ensure the Dockerfile uses a secure, minimal Python base image.
    -   [x] Add steps to copy the application code, install dependencies, and define the start command.
    -   [x] Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the image.
-   [x] **Task 3: Configure GCP Infrastructure** (Security: 1, 3)
    -   [x] Create a dedicated GCP Service Account for the chatbot application.
    -   [x] Grant the minimal IAM roles necessary for the service account to be invoked by Cloud Run.
-   [x] **Task 4: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline** (AC: 3)
    -   [x] Create a CI/CD workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy-chatbot.yml`).
    -   [x] Configure the workflow to trigger on pushes to the `main` branch.
    -   [x] Add steps to authenticate to GCP, build the Docker image, push it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploy to Cloud Run.
    -   [x] Ensure the deployment step configures the Cloud Run service to use the dedicated service account and secure ingress settings.
-   [x] **Task 5: Verify Deployment** (AC: 4, 5) - ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL**
    -   [x] Manually trigger the CI/CD pipeline. ✅ Cloud Build successful (4 builds completed)
    -   [x] Verify the pipeline completes successfully. ✅ Build, push, and infrastructure creation successful
    -   [x] Access the provided Cloud Run URL to confirm the "Hello World" message is displayed. ✅ **Service deployed and running at https://cwe-chatbot-258315443546.us-central1.run.app**
    -   [x] Check Google Cloud Logging to confirm application startup logs are present. ✅ Logs show successful Chainlit startup

## Dev Notes

* **Architecture Decision Reference:** This story directly implements the technical assumptions from the PRD to use **Chainlit** and **Google Cloud Run**.
* **Containerization:** The `Dockerfile` should be optimized for small image size and security. Use a multi-stage build if necessary to keep the final image lean.
* **CI/CD Authentication:** The CI/CD pipeline will need to be configured with credentials (e.g., via Workload Identity Federation or a service account key stored as a secret) to authenticate with GCP.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

* N/A for this story.

### Integration Tests

* N/A for this story.

### Security Verification

-   [ ] **IAM Permissions:** In the GCP Console, verify that the deployed Cloud Run service is running under the dedicated service account and that this account has no roles beyond the bare minimum (e.g., `roles/run.invoker`).
-   [ ] **Ingress Settings:** Verify the Cloud Run service's ingress setting is not "Allow all traffic".
-   [ ] **Image Scan:** Manually trigger a vulnerability scan on the built container image in Google Artifact Registry to check for known vulnerabilities in the base image.

### Manual Verification

-   [ ] After the CI/CD pipeline succeeds, access the Cloud Run service URL provided in the logs. The "Hello, welcome to CWE ChatBot!" message should appear.
-   [ ] Navigate to the Google Cloud Logging page for the Cloud Run service and confirm that startup logs are present.
-   [ ] Run the application locally (`chainlit run main.py`) to confirm it works outside the container.
