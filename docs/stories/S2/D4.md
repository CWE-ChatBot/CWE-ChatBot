## Issue #1: Chainlit /user Endpoint (401 Unauthorized) ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPECTED

**Count:** 123 warnings (77 + 46 from LB)
**Status:** HTTP 401 Unauthorized
**Severity:** LOW - Expected behavior

### Details

```
GET https://cwe.crashedmind.com/user
GET https://34.49.0.7/user

Status: 401 Unauthorized
User-Agent: Chrome (various versions)
```

### Root Cause

Chainlit's default configuration expects a `/user` endpoint to fetch authenticated user information. Since we're using custom OAuth integration with session management, this endpoint returns 401 for unauthenticated requests.

### Why This Happens

1. Chainlit frontend tries to fetch `/user` on initial load
2. Before OAuth completes, request is unauthenticated
3. Server correctly returns 401
4. Chainlit handles this gracefully and proceeds with OAuth flow

### Impact

- ‚úÖ **No functional impact** - OAuth works correctly
- ‚úÖ **No user-facing errors** - Handled by Chainlit client
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Log noise** - Creates warning entries

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Accept as normal (Recommended)
**Status:** This is expected Chainlit behavior

**Reasoning:**
- Standard Chainlit OAuth flow
- No functional issues
- User experience unaffected
- Alternative would require custom Chainlit fork

#### Option 2: Suppress 401 warnings in logging
**Code location:** Middleware or logging configuration

```python
# Suppress 401 warnings for specific endpoints
if request.path == "/user" and response.status_code == 401:
    # Don't log as WARNING
    pass
```

**Pros:** Cleaner logs
**Cons:** May hide legitimate auth issues

#### Option 3: Implement custom /user endpoint
**Complexity:** Medium

```python
@app.get("/user")
async def get_user():
    # Return user info if authenticated, 401 if not
    # But this duplicates OAuth session management
    pass
```

**Not recommended:** Adds complexity without benefit

### Recommendation

**Accept as normal behavior.** These 401s are part of Chainlit's standard OAuth flow and don't indicate a problem.

## Issue #2: Chainlit /logo Endpoint (404 Not Found) ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION

**Count:** 91 warnings (54 + 24 + 13 from various themes/sources)
**Status:** HTTP 404 Not Found
**Severity:** LOW - Missing optional feature

### Details

```
GET /logo?theme=dark&
GET /logo?theme=light&

Status: 404 Not Found
User-Agent: Chrome (various versions)
```

### Root Cause

Chainlit requests custom logo files for branding. No logo configured in our deployment.

### Configuration Options

Chainlit supports custom logos via `config.toml` or `.chainlit/` directory:

```toml
# .chainlit/config.toml
[UI]
name = "CWE ChatBot"
# Custom logo (optional)
logo_dark = "public/logo_dark.png"
logo_light = "public/logo_light.png"
```

### Impact

- ‚úÖ **No functional impact** - Application works fine
- ‚úÖ **Default Chainlit branding used** - Standard icon shows
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Log noise** - Creates 404 warnings

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Accept 404s (Current - OK)
**Status:** Working as designed

No logo configured = 404s expected. Chainlit gracefully falls back to default branding.

#### Option 2: Add custom logo (Enhancement)
**Files needed:**
- `public/logo_light.png` - Logo for light theme
- `public/logo_dark.png` - Logo for dark theme
- `.chainlit/config.toml` - Configuration

**Benefits:**
- Custom branding
- Cleaner logs (no 404s)
- Professional appearance

**Steps:**
1. Create CWE ChatBot logo (light and dark variants)
2. Place in `public/` directory
3. Update `.chainlit/config.toml`
4. Redeploy

#### Option 3: Suppress 404 warnings for /logo
Similar to /user endpoint, could suppress these specific 404s in logging.

### Recommendation

**Option 1: Accept for now.** Add custom logo as future enhancement if branding becomes important.

## Issue #3: Database Transaction Warnings ‚úÖ FIX DEPLOYED

**Count:** 34 warnings (28 + 6)
**Status:** WARNING - PostgreSQL nested transaction attempt ‚Üí **FIX DEPLOYED**
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Potential connection pool issue
**Deployment:** cwe-chatbot-00174-s24 (2025-10-10 20:35 UTC)

### Details

```
WARNING: there is already a transaction in progress

Sources:
- 28 warnings from host 10.8.0.2
- 6 warnings from host 10.8.0.3

Database: postgres
User: app_user
```

### Root Cause

Code is attempting to start a new transaction while one is already active. This typically happens when:

1. **Nested BEGIN statements** - `BEGIN` called twice without `COMMIT`
2. **Connection pooling issue** - Connection not properly released
3. **Context manager misuse** - Manual transaction control inside auto-commit context

### Previous Fix Context

From D3 investigation (commit 966c85f), we fixed similar issues in `pg_chunk_store.py`:
- Removed manual `conn.commit()` calls inside `with` blocks
- Context managers auto-commit on success
- Manual commits were closing cursors prematurely

### Investigation Needed

**Likely culprits:**
1. `apps/chatbot/src/db.py` - Database connection management
2. `apps/cwe_ingestion/cwe_ingestion/pg_chunk_store.py` - Query execution
3. Connection pooling configuration

**Check for:**
```python
# WRONG - nested transaction
with conn:
    conn.execute("BEGIN")  # Already in transaction from 'with'
    ...

# WRONG - manual commit in context manager
with conn:
    cursor.execute("...")
    conn.commit()  # Context manager will commit automatically
```

### Impact

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Functional:** Queries still work (PostgreSQL ignores duplicate BEGIN)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance:** May indicate connection not being released properly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Connection pool:** Could lead to pool exhaustion under load

### Solution Steps

1. **Identify source:**
```bash
# Find which code is causing these warnings
gcloud logging read 'textPayload=~"transaction in progress"' \
  --limit=50 --format=json | \
  jq -r '.[] | .labels' # Look for stack traces if available
```

2. **Review database code:**
```bash
# Check for manual BEGIN statements
grep -rn "BEGIN\|conn.commit()" apps/chatbot/src/db.py apps/cwe_ingestion/
```

3. **Check connection pooling:**
```python
# apps/chatbot/src/db.py
# Verify proper connection lifecycle management
```

4. **Test fix:**
- Apply fix
- Monitor for reduction in warnings
- Verify no connection pool exhaustion

### Fix Implemented ‚úÖ

**Commit:** b9665fb - "Fix database transaction warnings with connection state cleanup"
**Deployment:** cwe-chatbot-00174-s24
**Investigation:** See [D4_transaction_warnings_investigation.md](D4_transaction_warnings_investigation.md)

**Root Cause:**
- SQLAlchemy pooled connections not always returned in IDLE state
- psycopg attempts implicit BEGIN on next use ‚Üí "transaction in progress" warning
- Connection pool could exhaust under sustained load

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `_get_connection()` context manager in [pg_chunk_store.py](../../../apps/cwe_ingestion/cwe_ingestion/pg_chunk_store.py#L181)
- Added connection state validation before/after use
- Force rollback if connection not IDLE before pool return
- Added debug logging for lifecycle tracking

**Changes:**
1. Connection checkout logging: `"Checking out connection from SQLAlchemy pool"`
2. Status logging: `"Connection checked out, status: {status}"`
3. Completion logging: `"Connection use completed successfully, committing transaction"`
4. Cleanup check: Force rollback if status != IDLE
5. Cleanup logging: `"Connection not idle before pool return, status: {status}, forcing rollback"`
6. Pool return logging: `"Returning connection to pool"`

**Expected Impact:**
- Eliminate "transaction in progress" warnings
- Prevent connection pool exhaustion
- Cleaner logs for easier debugging
- No performance degradation (cleanup only when needed)

**Verification Plan:**
- Monitor logs for 24-48 hours
- Confirm warnings eliminated
- Check for cleanup rollbacks (indicates edge cases)
- Measure query performance (should be unchanged)

## Issue #4: Malicious Probe Attempts üîí BLOCKED (Expected)

**Count:** <10 warnings
**Status:** Various HTTP errors (404, 405)
**Severity:** INFO - Security working as expected

### Examples

```
GET /public/.env (404)
GET /assets/.env (404)
POST / (405 Method Not Allowed)
PROPFIND / (405)
```

### Analysis

These are automated security scanners looking for common vulnerabilities:
- `.env` files (configuration leaks)
- WebDAV endpoints (PROPFIND)
- Unprotected POST endpoints

### Impact

‚úÖ **Security working correctly** - All blocked
‚úÖ **Cloud Armor active** - Edge protection operational
‚úÖ **No vulnerabilities** - Standard hardening effective

### Recommendation

**No action needed.** These warnings confirm security measures are working.

  --format=json --limit=100 | \
  jq -r '.[] | .textPayload' | \
  wc -l
```

**Track endpoint 404s:**

gcloud logging read 'httpRequest.status=404 AND httpRequest.requestUrl=~"/logo"' \
  --format=json --limit=100 | \
  jq -r 'length'
```
