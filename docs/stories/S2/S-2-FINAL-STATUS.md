# S-2: LLM I/O Guardrails - Final Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE (2/7 AC met, 4/7 blocked by architecture)
**Outcome:** Documented existing guardrails; discovered app uses Gemini API (not Vertex AI)

## Executive Summary

Story S-2 was implemented following a "no-code-change" approach to add platform-level LLM guardrails. During deployment, we discovered the app uses `google.generativeai` (Gemini API SDK), not Vertex AI. **Model Armor and most platform-level guardrails require Vertex AI endpoints**, making them inapplicable to the current implementation.

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Completed (Valuable Work)

1. **SafetySetting Documentation** ([docs/runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md](../runbooks/S-2-safety-settings.md))
   - Documented current BLOCK_NONE configuration
   - Explained rationale for permissive thresholds (security content)
   - Described 3-layer defense architecture
   - **Value:** Operations team understands current config and reasoning

2. **Smoke Test Script** ([scripts/s2_smoke_test.py](../../scripts/s2_smoke_test.py))
   - Tests app-level defenses with attack payloads
   - Validates input sanitization and SafetySetting behavior
   - **Value:** Can test regression in current defenses

3. **Architecture Analysis** ([docs/stories/S-2-REALITY-CHECK.md](S-2-REALITY-CHECK.md))
   - Identified Gemini API vs Vertex AI mismatch
   - Documented what actually works vs what's blocked
   - Provided migration options and recommendations
   - **Value:** Prevents future wrong assumptions, guides roadmap

### üì¶ Archived (Future Use)

4. **Model Armor Setup Script** ([docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/s2_setup_model_armor.sh](../future/vertex-ai-migration/s2_setup_model_armor.sh))
   - Creates Model Armor template with all shields
   - Ready to use after Vertex AI migration
   - **Value:** Saved ~2 hours of future work

5. **Observability Setup Script** ([docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/s2_setup_observability.sh](../future/vertex-ai-migration/s2_setup_observability.sh))
   - Sets up metrics, alerts, and logging
   - Ready to use after Vertex AI migration
   - **Value:** Saved ~1 hour of future work

6. **Operations Runbook** ([docs/future/vertex-ai-migration/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md](../future/vertex-ai-migration/S-2-guardrails-runbook.md))
   - Incident response procedures for Model Armor
   - Ready to import after Vertex AI migration
   - **Value:** Saved ~3 hours of future work

## What's Actually Protecting the App

### Current 3-Layer Defense

1. **Application Security Layer**
   - Input sanitization (`InputSanitizer`)
   - SQL injection prevention (`SecureQueryBuilder`)
   - OAuth2 authentication (Google + GitHub)
   - Email whitelist authorization

2. **RAG Grounding Layer**
   - Responses constrained to 7,913 CWE chunks
   - Source citations for all claims
   - Prevents hallucination and off-topic responses

3. **SafetySetting Layer** (Permissive)
   - BLOCK_NONE for all categories (intentional)
   - Allows legitimate security vulnerability discussion
   - Last-resort protection only

### What's NOT Protecting the App

- ‚ùå Platform-level prompt injection detection (requires Vertex AI + Model Armor)
- ‚ùå Platform-level jailbreak detection (requires Vertex AI + Model Armor)
- ‚ùå Platform-level data loss prevention (requires Vertex AI + Model Armor)
- ‚ùå Platform-level malicious URL detection (requires Vertex AI + Model Armor)

## Acceptance Criteria Assessment

| AC | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|-------|
| AC-1 | Model Armor policies | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Requires Vertex AI (app uses Gemini API SDK) |
| AC-2 | Safety filters documented | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | BLOCK_NONE thresholds documented with rationale |
| AC-3 | Structured output | ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFERRED | Correctly deferred - requires app code changes |
| AC-4 | DLP inspection/redaction | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Model Armor DLP requires Vertex AI |
| AC-5 | Auditability & logging | üü° PARTIAL | App logging works; Vertex AI logs N/A |
| AC-6 | Grounding | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | RAG grounding works independently |
| AC-7 | Runbooks | üü° PARTIAL | SafetySetting docs useful; Model Armor docs archived |

**Summary:** 2 complete, 2 partial, 1 deferred, 2 blocked

## Security Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Threats Mitigated:**
- ‚úÖ SQL injection (app-level prevention)
- ‚úÖ Hallucination (RAG grounding)
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access (OAuth2 + whitelist)
- ‚úÖ Off-topic responses (RAG constraints)

**Threats NOT Fully Mitigated:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prompt injection attacks (app-level sanitization only, no platform detection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Jailbreak attempts (SafetySetting BLOCK_NONE = minimal protection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data exfiltration (input validation helps, no platform DLP)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System prompt extraction (no platform-level shields)

**Risk Acceptance:**
- App relies on 3 defense layers instead of 4 (original plan)
- Platform-level protections require Vertex AI migration (medium effort)
- Current defenses adequate for internal/controlled use
- NOT recommended for public-facing deployment without Vertex AI migration

## Lessons Learned (Following CLAUDE.md)

### ‚úÖ What We Did Right

1. **Honest Assessment** - Immediately documented reality when deployment failed
2. **No Theater** - Didn't pretend scripts work when they don't
3. **Reality Check** - Created comprehensive analysis of what actually works
4. **Salvage Value** - Archived useful work for future migration

### ‚ùå What Went Wrong

1. **Didn't verify actual LLM provider before planning** - Assumed Vertex AI without checking code
2. **Plan created scripts for wrong architecture** - Should have validated integration points first
3. **"No code changes" conflicted with requirements** - Model Armor needs Vertex AI = code changes
4. **Late verification** - Should have checked endpoints before creating infrastructure scripts

### üìö How to Prevent Next Time

Per CLAUDE.md principles:

> "REALITY CHECK": Before implementing anything, verify the actual integration points exist and work

**Apply this BEFORE planning:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check what the app actually uses
grep -r "import.*generativeai\|import.*vertexai" apps/chatbot/src/

# Step 2: Verify endpoints in running app
grep -r "googleapis.com" apps/chatbot/

# Step 3: Check environment variables
cat apps/chatbot/.env.example | grep -i vertex

# Step 4: Only then plan infrastructure based on REALITY
```

> "Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast."

**We created "make it right" scripts before "make it work" verification.**

Should have been:
1. ‚úÖ Verify what app uses (Gemini API SDK)
2. ‚úÖ Document current state (SafetySetting)
3. ‚úÖ Test current defenses (smoke test)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è THEN decide: migrate to Vertex AI OR accept current state OR add app-level detection

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Accept Current State (RECOMMENDED for now)
**Effort:** 1 hour (documentation only)
**Risk:** Medium-high (no platform-level prompt injection detection)

**Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Close S-2 as "Partially Complete" (already done)
2. ‚úÖ Archive Vertex AI scripts for future use (already done)
3. ‚úÖ Document current 3-layer defense as acceptable for internal use
4. Document risk acceptance for prompt injection attacks

**When to choose:** Internal/controlled deployment, low attack surface

### Option B: Add App-Level Prompt Injection Detection
**Effort:** 4-8 hours (app code changes + testing)
**Risk:** Low-medium (adds 4th defense layer without Vertex AI migration)

**Actions:**
1. Create story: "S-2B: App-Level Prompt Injection Detection"
2. Add regex-based detection to `InputSanitizer`
3. Test with smoke test attack payloads
4. Deploy without Vertex AI migration

**When to choose:** Public deployment, medium attack surface, can't migrate to Vertex AI yet

### Option C: Migrate to Vertex AI
**Effort:** 16-24 hours (full migration + testing + deployment)
**Risk:** Low (full platform-level protection)

**Actions:**
1. Create epic: "Vertex AI Migration"
2. Update `LLMProvider` to use `vertexai` SDK
3. Change from API key to service account authentication
4. Deploy all S-2 archived scripts (Model Armor, observability)
5. Full testing and validation

**When to choose:** Public deployment, high attack surface, long-term production use

### Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Effort | Low | Medium | High |
| Risk | Medium-High | Low-Medium | Low |
| Platform Shields | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| App-Level Detection | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Code Changes | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Cost | Low | Low | High (Vertex AI) |
| Time to Deploy | 1 hr | 4-8 hrs | 16-24 hrs |

## Conclusion

Story S-2 achieved partial success. We documented existing guardrails, created valuable testing tools, and discovered an architecture mismatch that prevents platform-level protections. The honest assessment and archived materials will accelerate future Vertex AI migration when business requirements justify the effort.

**Bottom Line:**
- ‚úÖ Current defenses (3 layers) are documented and understood
- ‚úÖ Testing tools exist to validate regression
- ‚úÖ Migration path is clear and materials are ready
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform-level protections blocked until Vertex AI migration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-high risk accepted for prompt injection attacks

**Recommendation:** Accept current state for internal use; plan Vertex AI migration for public deployment.
