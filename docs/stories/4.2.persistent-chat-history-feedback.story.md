# Story 4.2: Persistent Chat History Management and Enhanced User Feedback System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** cybersecurity professional,
**I want** persistent chat history storage and comprehensive feedback mechanisms for chatbot responses,
**so that** I can track my analysis progress, maintain context across sessions, and help improve the chatbot's accuracy over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** User conversations and individual messages are persistently stored in PostgreSQL database using the defined schema (Conversation and Message tables), allowing users to resume context across multiple sessions.
2. **AC2:** Chat history is accessible within the Chainlit interface, showing previous conversations with timestamps, CWE IDs discussed, and message content for authenticated users.
3. **AC3:** Users can provide structured feedback on individual chatbot responses through intuitive UI elements (thumbs up/down, detailed comments) directly within the chat interface.
4. **AC4:** Feedback data is securely collected and stored with appropriate data retention policies, including feedback type, user comments, message context, and timestamp.
5. **AC5:** Chat history and feedback data export functionality is available in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown) for user analysis and record-keeping purposes.
6. **AC6:** All chat history and feedback operations respect user privacy settings and data retention policies, with secure data handling for self-hosted deployments.

## Security Requirements
1. **Authentication:** Only authenticated users can access their own chat history; strict user isolation enforced at database level.
2. **Authorization:** Users can only view/export their own conversation data; admin users have aggregated analytics access without PII.
3. **Input Validation:** All feedback text input is sanitized to prevent XSS/injection attacks; file uploads are validated and virus-scanned.
4. **Data Protection:** Chat history contains sensitive security information and must be encrypted at rest; feedback data anonymization for analytics.
5. **Compliance:** GDPR-compliant data export and deletion capabilities; clear data retention policies with automated cleanup.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first formal BMad story, expanding on functionality briefly mentioned in Story 3.3 from the PRD. The goal is to create a comprehensive implementation for persistent storage and feedback mechanisms.

### Data Models
**Conversation Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#conversation]:
- `id`: UUID Primary Key
- `user_id`: UUID Foreign Key to User
- `session_id`: UUID for continuous interaction grouping
- `start_time`, `end_time`: Timestamp fields for session tracking
- `current_context`: JSONB for conversational context preservation (NFR35)

**Message Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#message]:
- `id`: UUID Primary Key
- `conversation_id`: UUID Foreign Key
- `sender`: 'user' | 'chatbot'
- `content`: TEXT for message content
- `timestamp`: Message creation time
- `is_feedback_eligible`: Boolean for feedback capability (FR27)
- `feedback_provided`: Boolean tracking feedback status
- `cwe_ids_suggested`: VARCHAR(50)[] for CWE traceability
- `llm_model_used`: VARCHAR(255) for BYO model auditing

### Database Schema
**PostgreSQL Implementation** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#traditional-database-schema-postgresql-ddl]:
- Conversations table with CASCADE delete for referential integrity
- Messages table with conversation_id foreign key
- Indexes on user_id, session_id, conversation_id, and timestamp for query optimization
- JSONB fields for flexible schema evolution (preferences, current_context)

### API Specifications
**Chat History Endpoints** [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]:
- GET /api/conversations - List user conversations with pagination
- GET /api/conversations/{id}/messages - Retrieve conversation messages
- POST /api/conversations/{id}/export - Generate export files
- POST /api/messages/{id}/feedback - Submit message feedback

### Component Specifications
**Chainlit Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-ui]:
- Chainlit 0.7.x provides built-in user session management and authentication hooks
- Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling custom UI components (chat history sidebar, feedback buttons)
- Built-in streaming support for real-time message display with persistent storage

### File Locations
**Implementation Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- XSS attacks through feedback comment injection
- Database injection through conversation/message queries
- Social engineering to extract sensitive chat history data

**Required Security Controls**:
- Row-level security policies for user data isolation
- Input sanitization for all user-provided feedback content
- Access logging for audit trails of data access
- Rate limiting on feedback submission to prevent spam/abuse

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Parameterized queries with proper SQL injection prevention
- Content Security Policy headers for XSS prevention
- Regular security audits of data access patterns
- Encryption at rest for sensitive conversation content

### Testing Standards
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Unit tests in `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/` for service layer testing
- Integration tests in `apps/chatbot/tests/integration/` for database operations
- E2E tests using Playwright for complete user workflows
- Security tests for access control validation and input sanitization

- [ ] **Input Validation:** Test all feedback inputs for proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] **Authentication Tests:** Verify users can only access their own conversation history and cannot view other users' data.
- [ ] **Authorization Tests:** Confirm proper access controls are enforced for conversation viewing, export, and feedback operations.
- [ ] **Data Protection:** Validate that sensitive conversation content is properly handled and encrypted at rest.
- [ ] **Malformed Data Handling:** Test the system with malformed feedback data and invalid conversation IDs to ensure graceful error handling.
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention:** Test all database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities with malicious input.
- [ ] **XSS Prevention:** Test feedback comment submission for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Cross-User Data Access:** Attempt to access other users' conversations using manipulated session data or API calls.
