# Story 4.2: Persistent Chat History Management and Enhanced User Feedback System

## Status
In Progress - Feedback Buttons Working (2025-10-13)

## Story
**As a** cybersecurity professional,
**I want** persistent chat history storage and comprehensive feedback mechanisms for chatbot responses,
**so that** I can track my analysis progress, maintain context across sessions, and help improve the chatbot's accuracy over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC1:** User conversations and individual messages are persistently stored in PostgreSQL database using the defined schema (Conversation and Message tables), allowing users to resume context across multiple sessions.
2. **AC2:** Chat history is accessible within the Chainlit interface, showing previous conversations with timestamps, CWE IDs discussed, and message content for authenticated users.
3. **AC3:** Users can provide structured feedback on individual chatbot responses through intuitive UI elements (thumbs up/down, detailed comments) directly within the chat interface.
4. **AC4:** Feedback data is securely collected and stored with appropriate data retention policies, including feedback type, user comments, message context, and timestamp.
5. **AC5:** Chat history and feedback data export functionality is available in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown) for user analysis and record-keeping purposes.
6. **AC6:** All chat history and feedback operations respect user privacy settings and data retention policies, with secure data handling for self-hosted deployments.

## Security Requirements
1. **Authentication:** Only authenticated users can access their own chat history; strict user isolation enforced at database level.
2. **Authorization:** Users can only view/export their own conversation data; admin users have aggregated analytics access without PII.
3. **Input Validation:** All feedback text input is sanitized to prevent XSS/injection attacks; file uploads are validated and virus-scanned.
4. **Data Protection:** Chat history contains sensitive security information and must be encrypted at rest; feedback data anonymization for analytics.
5. **Compliance:** GDPR-compliant data export and deletion capabilities; clear data retention policies with automated cleanup.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first formal BMad story, expanding on functionality briefly mentioned in Story 3.3 from the PRD. The goal is to create a comprehensive implementation for persistent storage and feedback mechanisms.

### Data Models
**Conversation Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#conversation]:
- `id`: UUID Primary Key
- `user_id`: UUID Foreign Key to User
- `session_id`: UUID for continuous interaction grouping
- `start_time`, `end_time`: Timestamp fields for session tracking
- `current_context`: JSONB for conversational context preservation (NFR35)

**Message Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#message]:
- `id`: UUID Primary Key
- `conversation_id`: UUID Foreign Key
- `sender`: 'user' | 'chatbot'
- `content`: TEXT for message content
- `timestamp`: Message creation time
- `is_feedback_eligible`: Boolean for feedback capability (FR27)
- `feedback_provided`: Boolean tracking feedback status
- `cwe_ids_suggested`: VARCHAR(50)[] for CWE traceability
- `llm_model_used`: VARCHAR(255) for BYO model auditing

### Database Schema
**PostgreSQL Implementation** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#traditional-database-schema-postgresql-ddl]:
- Conversations table with CASCADE delete for referential integrity
- Messages table with conversation_id foreign key
- Indexes on user_id, session_id, conversation_id, and timestamp for query optimization
- JSONB fields for flexible schema evolution (preferences, current_context)

### API Specifications
**Chat History Endpoints** [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]:
- GET /api/conversations - List user conversations with pagination
- GET /api/conversations/{id}/messages - Retrieve conversation messages
- POST /api/conversations/{id}/export - Generate export files
- POST /api/messages/{id}/feedback - Submit message feedback

### Component Specifications
**Chainlit Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-ui]:
- Chainlit 0.7.x provides built-in user session management and authentication hooks
- Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling custom UI components (chat history sidebar, feedback buttons)
- Built-in streaming support for real-time message display with persistent storage

### File Locations
**Implementation Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `apps/chatbot/src/services/chat_history_service.py` - Chat history business logic
- `apps/chatbot/src/services/feedback_service.py` - User feedback processing
- `apps/chatbot/src/api/conversations.py` - REST API endpoints
- `apps/chatbot/src/ui_elements/` - Custom Chainlit components for history/feedback
- `packages/shared/src/data_models/` - Shared Pydantic models
- `apps/chatbot/tests/` - Unit and integration tests

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- PostgreSQL 14.x for traditional database operations
- Redis 6.x for caching conversation context and session data
- Google Cloud Storage for large export file storage
- Chainlit framework for UI integration and real-time updates

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]:
- Pytest for unit and integration testing
- Playwright for end-to-end UI testing of chat history and feedback flows
- Database transaction testing for conversation and message operations
- Security testing for access controls and data isolation

### Threat Considerations
**Attack Surfaces**:
- Database queries could expose cross-user data if improperly isolated
- File export functionality could enable data exfiltration
- Feedback input forms present XSS/injection attack vectors
- Chat history storage increases data breach impact

**Threat Scenarios**:
- Malicious user attempts to access other users' conversation history
- XSS attacks through feedback comment injection
- Database injection through conversation/message queries
- Social engineering to extract sensitive chat history data

**Required Security Controls**:
- Row-level security policies for user data isolation
- Input sanitization for all user-provided feedback content
- Access logging for audit trails of data access
- Rate limiting on feedback submission to prevent spam/abuse

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Parameterized queries with proper SQL injection prevention
- Content Security Policy headers for XSS prevention
- Regular security audits of data access patterns
- Encryption at rest for sensitive conversation content

### Testing Standards
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Unit tests in `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/` for service layer testing
- Integration tests in `apps/chatbot/tests/integration/` for database operations
- E2E tests using Playwright for complete user workflows
- Security tests for access control validation and input sanitization

## Testing

- [ ] **Input Validation:** Test all feedback inputs for proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] **Authentication Tests:** Verify users can only access their own conversation history and cannot view other users' data.
- [ ] **Authorization Tests:** Confirm proper access controls are enforced for conversation viewing, export, and feedback operations.
- [ ] **Data Protection:** Validate that sensitive conversation content is properly handled and encrypted at rest.
- [ ] **Malformed Data Handling:** Test the system with malformed feedback data and invalid conversation IDs to ensure graceful error handling.
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention:** Test all database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities with malicious input.
- [ ] **XSS Prevention:** Test feedback comment submission for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Cross-User Data Access:** Attempt to access other users' conversations using manipulated session data or API calls.

### Manual Verification

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary (2025-10-13)

**Agent Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Completed Work

#### Task 3: User Feedback System Implementation (AC: 3, 4) - PARTIAL COMPLETION

**✅ Feedback Buttons Working:**
- Feedback buttons (thumbs up/down) now appear on assistant messages
- Users can click feedback buttons and provide comments
- Chat history sidebar shows conversation threads
- Authentication enabled (password auth for staging)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Chainlit SQLAlchemyDataLayer Integration** (`apps/chatbot/main.py:36-41`)
   - Initialized SQLAlchemyDataLayer with `@cl.data_layer` decorator
   - Connected to PostgreSQL database via asyncpg
   - Database URL: `postgresql+asyncpg://app_user:PASSWORD@/chainlit`

2. **Database Schema Setup** (Cloud SQL: `chainlit` database)
   - Created tables: `users`, `threads`, `steps`, `elements`, `feedbacks`
   - Used lowercase table names (SQLAlchemy requirement vs Prisma PascalCase)
   - Column types: TEXT for datetime fields (not TIMESTAMP)
   - Required columns for feedback:
     - `steps.disableFeedback` BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
     - `steps.defaultOpen` BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
     - `feedbacks.forId` UUID (references step ID)

3. **Authentication Requirement** (`apps/chatbot/main.py:58-65`)
   - Added temporary password_auth_callback for staging
   - Feedback buttons require authentication to be enabled
   - Any username/password accepted for testing
   - Production will use OAuth (Google/GitHub)

4. **Critical Bug Fix: cl.Step Blocking Feedback** (`apps/chatbot/main.py:1073-1078`)
   - **Root Cause:** `async with cl.Step()` context manager blocks feedback buttons
   - **Issue:** Chainlit bug where messages sent inside Step context don't show feedback
   - **Reference:** https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/issues/1202
   - **Fix:** Removed cl.Step wrapper around message processing (TEMPORARY)
   - **Impact:** "Analyze security query" step no longer visible, but feedback works

5. **Configuration** (`apps/chatbot/src/.chainlit/config.toml:46-47`)
   - `[features.feedback] enabled = true` (config exists but ignored in Chainlit 2.8.0)
   - Feedback is controlled by data layer presence, not config

### Debug Log References

Key debugging findings during implementation:
- Data layer registration confirmed: `[STARTUP] Data layer registered: <class 'chainlit.data.sql_alchemy.SQLAlchemyDataLayer'>`
- Database connection errors: Initially failed due to schema mismatches
- Column errors: `defaultOpen` and `disableFeedback` were missing
- Type errors: Changed TIMESTAMP columns back to TEXT to match SQLAlchemy expectations
- Step blocking: Discovered cl.Step prevents feedback buttons from appearing

### Known Issues & Next Steps

**TODO: Implement cl.Step Without Blocking Feedback**

The current solution removes cl.Step entirely, which works but loses the "Analyze security query" UI feedback.

**Approach to restore cl.Step without blocking feedback:**

1. **Separate retrieval work from message sending:**
   ```python
   # In main.py - Create Step for retrieval only
   async with cl.Step(name="Analyze security query", type="tool") as analysis_step:
       analysis_step.input = f"Query: '{user_query[:100]}...'"

       # Get the pipeline result WITHOUT sending message
       result = await conversation_manager.process_user_message_no_send(
           session_id=session_id,
           message_content=user_query,
           message_id=message.id
       )

       analysis_step.output = f"Retrieved {result['chunk_count']} chunks"

   # OUTSIDE Step context - send the actual message
   await conversation_manager.send_message_from_result(result)
   ```

2. **Modify conversation.py to support two-phase processing:**
   - Add `process_user_message_no_send()` - returns result dict without sending message
   - Add `send_message_from_result()` - creates and sends message from result dict
   - Keep existing `process_user_message_streaming()` for follow-up questions

3. **Testing approach:**
   - Verify feedback buttons still appear after restoring Step
   - Ensure "Analyze security query" step shows retrieval stats
   - Confirm chat history and feedback persistence still work

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `apps/chatbot/main.py` - Added SQLAlchemyDataLayer, password auth, removed cl.Step
- `apps/chatbot/src/.chainlit/config.toml` - Enabled feedback feature

- Applied SQLAlchemy schema (5 tables: users, threads, steps, elements, feedbacks)

**Scripts:**
- `/tmp/chainlit_schema.sql` - Database schema creation
- `/tmp/add_columns.sql` - Added missing columns (disableFeedback, defaultOpen)

### Configuration Details
