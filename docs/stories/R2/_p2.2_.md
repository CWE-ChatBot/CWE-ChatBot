2. Embrace Chainlit for State Management
You've correctly identified that cl.user_session is the place for state, but some parts of the code still hint at a separate, in-memory state manager.

Recommendations:

Remove No-Op Methods: In ConversationManager, methods like _add_message, get_conversation_history, and cleanup_expired_sessions are no-ops because Chainlit handles this. Remove them to simplify the class.

Centralize Context Access: You have a great helper in src/utils/session.py. Use get_user_context() consistently everywhere you need session state (main.py, ConversationManager) instead of accessing cl.user_session directly. This ensures the UserContext object is always properly initialized.

Simplify Context Initialization: In ConversationManager._get_or_create_user_context, you re-assign the selected chat profile. This logic is better placed in @cl.on_chat_start in main.py, where the context is first created for the session.

Python

# In main.py @cl.on_chat_start
from src.utils.session import get_user_context

@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    # ...
    # Initialize or get context
    context = get_user_context()
    
    # Set the persona from the selected chat profile
    selected_profile = cl.user_session.get("chat_profile", UserPersona.DEVELOPER.value)
    if context.persona != selected_profile:
        context.persona = selected_profile
    
    # ... rest of the start logic

Short answer: yes—this is a good simplification for a typical single-process Chainlit app. Using cl.user_session + a single get_user_context() helper as the only source of truth reduces bugs and removes dead code. Moving persona selection into @cl.on_chat_start is also the right lifecycle hook.

Why I agree

Single source of truth: get_user_context() prevents scattered direct access to cl.user_session and guarantees the context is initialized consistently.

Cleaner ConversationManager: If _add_message, get_conversation_history, and cleanup_expired_sessions are truly no-ops, deleting them removes noise and the illusion of alternate state.

Correct lifecycle: Persona/profile selection belongs in on_chat_start so it’s set once per chat and stays stable.

Caveats to keep in mind

Scaling / multi-worker: cl.user_session is in-memory per worker. If you plan to run multiple workers or pods, or need cross-session persistence, you’ll still need an external store (DB/Redis) for any state you can’t afford to lose.

Background work: If you spawn tasks that outlive the WebSocket, pass the minimal state they need (IDs, persona) explicitly; they won’t have cl.user_session available.

History vs. UI transcript: Chainlit renders the chat log, but if you maintain your own summarized conversation context for prompts, keep that logic (summarization/truncation) in your pipeline; don’t assume the UI history replaces it.

Minimal refactor sketch

Delete dead methods in ConversationManager: _add_message, get_conversation_history, cleanup_expired_sessions.

Replace all direct cl.user_session[...] reads/writes with get_user_context() across main.py, ConversationManager, etc.

Move persona selection to @cl.on_chat_start (your snippet is spot-on), making it idempotent.

Example (concise):

# main.py
from src.utils.session import get_user_context
from src.types import UserPersona
import chainlit as cl

@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    context = get_user_context()  # ensures it's created and stored
    selected_profile = cl.user_session.get(
        "chat_profile", UserPersona.DEVELOPER.value
    )
    if context.persona != selected_profile:
        context.persona = selected_profile
    # ... rest of start logic

# src/conversation.py (inside ConversationManager)
from src.utils.session import get_user_context

def _get_or_create_user_context(self):
    # now just:
    return get_user_context()
