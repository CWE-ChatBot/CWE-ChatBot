P0 – Blocking bugs & correctness (fix these first)

Broken call sites: get_user_context doesn’t exist but is awaited twice

In main.py you call await conversation_manager.get_user_context(...) (sync method doesn’t exist).

Fix: add a public wrapper and stop awaiting it.

# src/conversation.py
class ConversationManager:
    ...
    def get_user_context(self, session_id: str) -> UserContext:
        return self._get_or_create_user_context(session_id)

# main.py (both places)
user_context = conversation_manager.get_user_context(session_id)


Explanation builder can’t see any text (uses content, your chunks use document)

Symptoms: empty snippets, weak explanations, weird “no info” bullets.

Fix:

# src/processing/explanation_builder.py (_extract_snippet_candidates)
content = chunk.get("document") or chunk.get("content", "")


And fix CWE name extraction (your metadata uses name):

# _extract_cwe_name
cwe_name = chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("name") \
           or chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("cwe_name")


Confidence scoring never sees scores (you store them under scores.hybrid)

Symptoms: all confidence ≈ 0 → “low confidence” banners too often.

Fix the aggregator to read your shape:

# src/processing/confidence_calculator.py (create_aggregated_cwe)
score = chunk.get("score")
if score is None:
    s = (chunk.get("scores") or {})
    score = s.get("hybrid", s.get("vec", 0.0))
if isinstance(score, (int, float)):
    top_scores.append(float(score))


Healthcheck port mismatch

healthcheck.py hits :8080, Chainlit defaults to :8000.

Fix: make the port configurable and default to 8000.

P1 – Security & safety (tighten without losing capability)

Gemini safety set to BLOCK_NONE across all categories

That invites accidental “exploit tutorials” leakage and will cause trust/compliance headaches.

Fix: gate this by env and default to safer thresholds; keep “Dangerous Content” ≥ BLOCK_SOME by default.

# src/llm_provider.py (GoogleProvider.__init__)
allow_unrestricted = os.getenv("ALLOW_UNSAFE_SECURITY_CONTENT", "0").lower() in ("1","true","yes")
default_thresh = HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_SOME
danger_thresh  = HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE if allow_unrestricted else HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_SOME
self._safety = [
  {"category": HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT,          "threshold": default_thresh},
  {"category": HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,         "threshold": default_thresh},
  {"category": HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT,   "threshold": default_thresh},
  {"category": HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT,   "threshold": danger_thresh},
]


Also add a guardrail line in your persona prompts (Developer, Bounty, etc.): “Do not provide step-by-step exploit instructions; focus on mitigation, detection, and high-level concepts.”

Sanitizer/validator tuning

Add IPv6 masking and common API token shapes, reduce false positives on legitimate shell words inside code blocks (you already strip fenced code for scanning — good).

# src/input_security.py (validate_response)
ipv6 = r'\b(?:[A-F0-9]{0,4}:){2,7}[A-F0-9]{0,4}\b'
text = re.sub(ipv6, '[REDACTED_IPv6]', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)


OAuth allowlist clarity

You enforce auth in handlers (good). Document ALLOWED_USERS semantics in README and support @domain.tld + emails (you already do both). Consider returning a friendly UI message on rejection.

P2 – Simpler, more Chainlit-native UX (less custom code to maintain)

Use Chainlit Steps for visible pipeline stages

You already do a step for file processing. Add two more tiny steps so users “see” progress:

# src/conversation.py (around retrieval)
async with cl.Step(name="Retrieve CWE context", type="tool") as st:
    st.input = combined_query
    retrieved_chunks = await self.query_handler.process_query(combined_query, user_context_data)
    st.output = f"{len(retrieved_chunks)} chunks from hybrid search"

# (around generation)
async with cl.Step(name="Generate answer", type="run") as st:
    # stream as you do; optionally set st.output to token count at end


Use Chainlit’s AskFileMessage for uploads

Replaces some custom prompts and reduces confusion:

await cl.AskFileMessage(
  content="Upload a PDF or text file with your vuln notes.",
  accept=["application/pdf","text/*","application/json"],
  max_size_mb=10
).send()


Progressive disclosure

Your “basic detail” split works. Also consider a collapsible cl.Text with display="inline" for summary and display="side" for details (you already do this) — keep it, but gate on token count so it doesn’t trigger on short answers.

P2 – Architecture & consistency (trim complexity)

Two config entry points

You have src/app_config.py (re-exporter) and src/app_config_extended.py. Drop the re-exporter; keep one Config (the extended one). That removes import ambiguity and circular-import risk.

Chunk shape consistency

Standardize on:
{"metadata": {"cwe_id","name","section","section_rank"}, "document": str, "scores": {"hybrid",...}}

Then enforce this in:

ExplanationBuilder (use document)

ConfidenceCalculator (read scores.hybrid)

ResponseGenerator._build_context (already uses document)

QueryHandler._fetch_cwe_sections (already returns document + scores)

Public context accessor

You created it in P0; also use it everywhere instead of directly touching cl.user_session in multiple files. Centralize session keys in src/utils/session.py.

Initialization runs twice

initialize_components() runs on import and in main_cli(). Guard it:

if _init_ok:
    return _init_ok

P3 – DX, performance, observability

LLM fallbacks

You already do a nice contextual fallback. Add a tiny metric: count fallbacks and expose via a simple /metrics or as a Step output to help triage outages.

RRF weights sanity

You validate sum=1 (great). Log on startup the exact RRF_* envs in one line so prod overrides are visible.

Testing

Add a quick unit test to prevent regressions on the three P0 fixes:

ExplanationBuilder picks up document

create_aggregated_cwe reads scores.hybrid

ConversationManager.get_user_context exists and is used without await

SDK drift resilience (Gemini)

Wrap the .text extraction in a helper that also tries candidates/parts if text is None. This avoids breakage with SDK updates while keeping your current code path.

Micro-patches (copy/paste)

Prefer a non-intrusive “focus” hint over an extra system message:

# src/conversation.py – replace “Focusing on CWE-xxx” system send
preface = f"Focusing on {canonical}\n\n"
msg = cl.Message(content=preface)  # one message only; fewer bubbles


Make SECURITY_MODE explicit (docstring and enum), default FLAG_ONLY. If BLOCK, show a short toast (Chainlit message) explaining why the input was blocked.

What you get after these changes

Correctness: explanations & confidence scoring line up with your actual chunk schema.

Safety: sane defaults, optional relaxed mode via env; prompts steer away from step-by-step exploitation.

Simplicity: fewer custom bits; more Chainlit Steps and AskFileMessage.

Maintainability: one config path; one context accessor; consistent chunk shape.

UX: clear pipeline progress; lightweight “focus” cue; progressive detail that only triggers when needed.
