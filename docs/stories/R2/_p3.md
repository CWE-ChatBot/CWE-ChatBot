Priority 3: Security and Dependency Management
You have a good focus on security, but there are a few areas to harden.

1. API Key Handling
API keys are passed as arguments from main.py -> ConversationManager -> CWEQueryHandler/ResponseGenerator. This exposes the key in more places than necessary.

Recommendation: Let the classes that need the key load it themselves directly from the environment. This follows the principle of least privilege.

Python

# In response_generator.py
from src.config import config # Use the new simplified config

class ResponseGenerator:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"):
        # The key is no longer passed in. It's loaded from the central config.
        gemini_api_key = config.gemini_api_key 
        if not gemini_api_key:
             raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured.")
        
        self.provider = get_llm_provider(api_key=gemini_api_key, ...)
        # ...

# In CWEQueryHandler, do the same
from src.config import config

class CWEQueryHandler:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str, ...):
        gemini_api_key = config.gemini_api_key
        # ...
2. Dependency Management (cwe_ingestion)
The try/except block with sys.path.insert in query_handler.py is brittle and not a standard Python practice. It can lead to unpredictable behavior depending on the execution environment.

Recommendation:
Treat cwe_ingestion as a proper local, editable package. In your project's pyproject.toml, add it as a development dependency that points to its local path.

Ini, TOML

# In your pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
# ... your other dependencies

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
cwe-ingestion = { path = "../path/to/cwe_ingestion", develop = true }
Then you can just run poetry install and the import from cwe_ingestion... will work reliably without any path manipulation.

Priority 4: Leveraging Chainlit and Code-Level Refinements
These are smaller changes that will improve the user experience and code readability.

1. Visualize Processing with cl.Step
The on_message function performs several distinct actions: processing attachments, running security checks, retrieving documents, and generating a response. You can make this transparent to the user by wrapping these stages in cl.Step.

Python

# In main.py @cl.on_message
@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    # ...
    async with cl.Step(name="Sanitizing Input", type="tool") as step:
        # Your sanitization logic here...
        step.output = "Input is safe."

    async with cl.Step(name="Retrieving CWE Information", type="tool") as step:
        # Your query_handler call...
        retrieved_chunks = await self.query_handler.process_query(...)
        step.output = f"Found {len(retrieved_chunks)} relevant documents."

    async with cl.Step(name="Generating Response", type="llm") as step:
        # Your response_generator logic...
        # This step can even contain the streaming message itself.
        msg = cl.Message(content="")
        async for token in response_stream:
            await msg.stream_token(token)
        await msg.send()
2. Modularize UI Components in main.py
The main.py file contains large multi-line strings for the welcome message and persona descriptions. This makes the file harder to read.

Recommendation: Move these UI-related components into a separate helper module, for example src/ui/messaging.py.

Python

# src/ui/messaging.py
def get_welcome_message(user: cl.User | None) -> str:
    # ... logic to build the welcome message
    return "..."

def get_persona_guide_element() -> cl.Text:
    # ... logic to build the persona guide
    return cl.Text(...)

# In main.py
from src.ui import messaging

@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    # ...
    welcome_text = messaging.get_welcome_message(user)
    persona_guide = messaging.get_persona_guide_element()
    await cl.Message(content=welcome_text, elements=[persona_guide]).send()
3. Improve LLMProvider Flexibility
The GoogleProvider has hardcoded logic to disable safety settings. While this is noted in the comments, it's better to make it a configurable default that can be overridden. The current implementation already checks if safety_settings is provided, which is good. You can make this even clearer by defining the default in the get_llm_provider factory function.

Recommendation: Centralize the default safety settings logic in the factory.

Python

# In llm_provider.py
def get_llm_provider(...):
    # ...
    if provider == "google":
        # If no safety settings are provided by the caller, use the permissive default.
        final_safety_settings = safety_settings
        if final_safety_settings is None:
            # Your logic to create the BLOCK_NONE settings list
            final_safety_settings = [...] 
            logger.info("Applying default permissive safety settings for Google provider.")

        return GoogleProvider(
            # ...
            safety_settings=final_safety_settings,
        )
    # ...
This makes the GoogleProvider class itself more generic and places the application-specific default in the factory where it belongs.
