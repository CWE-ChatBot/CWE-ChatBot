# Story 3.2: Refined Mapping Suggestions & Explanations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** precise and explained CWE mapping suggestions,
**so that** I can quickly understand the relevance and reasoning behind the recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** The ChatBot presents a concise list of prioritized CWE recommendations, each accompanied by a clear confidence score (NFR22), **verifiable through local test queries and inspecting the UI output.**
2. **AC2:** The system intelligently limits the number of suggested CWEs to avoid information overload and explicitly avoids recommending Prohibited or Discouraged CWEs from the corpus (NFR23).
3. **AC3:** The ChatBot provides clear, concise explanations for its mapping reasoning, ideally quoting relevant snippets from CWE descriptions, mapping notes, or related documentation (FR16, NFR24), **verifiable by reviewing chatbot explanations for a diverse set of queries locally.**
4. **AC4:** The system allows users to explore CWE relationships (e.g., parent/child relationships, associations) directly within the conversation, enabling chaining of related concepts (NFR25), **verifiable through interactive local testing of relationship queries.**
5. **AC5:** For low-confidence suggestions, the ChatBot proactively offers specific guidance to the user on how to refine their input or provide more detail to improve the accuracy of future recommendations (NFR26), **verifiable by submitting ambiguous inputs locally and checking the chatbot's response.**

## Security Requirements

1. **Authentication:** No new authentication requirements - utilizes existing OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect through Chainlit
2. **Authorization:** No additional authorization controls needed - leverages existing role-based access
3. **Input Validation:** All relationship queries and confidence scoring inputs must be validated through existing InputSanitizer
4. **Data Protection:** Ensure confidence scores and explanations do not expose sensitive internal system information
5. **Compliance:** Maintain existing compliance standards for CWE data handling and user query processing

## Dev Notes

### Existing Infrastructure Analysis (from Implementation Plan)

#### ðŸŸ¢ Reusable Components Already Available
**Core RAG Infrastructure (Story 2.1):**
- **Query Handler** (`apps/chatbot/src/query_handler.py`): Production-ready hybrid retrieval system
  - PostgreSQL + vector database integration with Gemini embeddings (3072D)
  - Hybrid scoring (vector + FTS + alias matching) already returns scored results with metadata
  - Interface: `process_query(query, user_context)` returns List[Dict] with scores and metadata
- **Response Generator** (`apps/chatbot/src/response_generator.py`): Persona-specific response generation
  - Role-based prompting for Developer, PSIRT, Academic Researcher, Bug Bounty Hunter, Product Manager
  - Context building from retrieved chunks via `_build_context()` method
  - Source attribution and CWE references already implemented
- **Vector Database**: Production CWE corpus (969 CWEs, 7,913 chunks with 14 semantic sections)
  - Contains relationship data in existing corpus sections
  - Proven performance with halfvec optimization achieving 1.8x speedup
- **Query Processor** (`apps/chatbot/src/processing/query_processor.py`):
  - CWE extraction and enhancement capabilities
  - Security-first input processing through InputSanitizer
  - Query type classification and follow-up processing

#### ðŸŸ¡ Enhancement Points (Gaps to Address)
**Confidence Scoring:** Basic hybrid scores exist but need normalization to 0-1 scale and thresholds
**CWE Filtering:** No current filtering of Prohibited/Discouraged CWEs from corpus metadata
**Explanation Generation:** Basic context building exists but lacks reasoning explanations with citations
**Relationship Exploration:** Relationship data exists in chunks but no structured access implemented
**Low-Confidence Guidance:** Only basic fallback responses exist, no improvement suggestions

### Technical Architecture Integration

#### File Structure and Implementation Details
**New modules with complete interfaces:**

**1. `apps/chatbot/src/processing/confidence_calculator.py`**
```python
from typing import TypedDict, Literal
ConfidenceLevel = Literal["High", "Medium", "Low", "Very Low"]

class AggregatedCWE(TypedDict):
    cwe_id: str
    name: str
    top_hybrid_scores: list[float]     # top 3 scores from retrieval
    exact_alias_match: bool            # exact name/alias hit
    section_hits: dict[str, int]       # {"Description":2,"Consequences":1}
    source_count: int                  # distinct chunks

class ConfidenceCalculator:
    def score(self, agg: AggregatedCWE) -> float:
        # Returns 0.0-1.0 confidence using weighted factors
    def level(score: float) -> ConfidenceLevel:
        # High>=0.80, Medium>=0.60, Low>=0.40, Very Low<0.40
```

**2. `apps/chatbot/src/processing/cwe_filter.py`**
```python
MAX_RECS = 5

class CWEFilter:
    def __init__(self, prohibited: set[str], discouraged: set[str]):
        # Initialize with prohibited/discouraged CWE sets
    def filter(self, recs: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
        # Remove prohibited/discouraged, cap to MAX_RECS
```

**3. `apps/chatbot/src/processing/explanation_builder.py`**
```python
class ExplanationBuilder:
    def build(self, query: str, cwe_id: str, chunks: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        # Returns: {"snippets": [...], "bullets": [...]}
        # Max 2 snippets, 240 chars each, with section citations
```

**4. `apps/chatbot/src/repositories/relationship_repo.py`**
```python
class RelationshipRepo:
    async def get_relationships(self, cwe_id: str) -> Dict[str, List[dict]]:
        # Returns: {"ParentOf": [...], "ChildOf": [...], "RelatedTo": [...]}
```

**5. `apps/chatbot/src/processing/query_suggester.py`**
```python
PERSONA_HINTS = {
    "Developer": ["Add language/framework", "Include failing function name"],
    "PSIRT Member": ["Provide product/version", "Add CVE if known"],
    # ...
}

class QuerySuggester:
    def suggest(self, query: str, persona: str) -> List[str]:
        # Returns max 3 improvement suggestions
```

#### Integration Points and Data Flow
**Core Pipeline:** query â†’ retrieve â†’ aggregate by CWE â†’ score â†’ explain â†’ filter â†’ sort â†’ return

**Updated CWEQueryHandler.process_query() returns:**
```python
class Recommendation(TypedDict):
    cwe_id: str
    name: str
    confidence: float
    level: Literal["High","Medium","Low","Very Low"]
    explanation: dict        # {"snippets":[...], "bullets":[...]}
    top_chunks: list[dict]   # server-side only
    relationships: dict | None

# Return format:
{
    "recommendations": List[Recommendation],
    "low_confidence": bool
}
```

**Updated ResponseGenerator with MappingRenderer:**
```python
class MappingRenderer:
    def render(recommendations: List[Dict], persona: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Returns: {"markdown": "...", "actions": [...]}

# Response format with actions for Chainlit:
{
    "content": markdown_string,
    "actions": [{"name": "explore_relationships", "value": cwe_id, "label": "..."}],
    "meta": {"has_recommendations": bool}
}
```

#### Dependencies and Integration Strategy
**Reuse Existing Infrastructure:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- CWEQueryHandler retrieval pipeline (hybrid scoring already implemented)
- ResponseGenerator persona-specific rendering
- InputSanitizer for all new user inputs
- Existing Chainlit action system for UI interactions

**Configuration Sources:**
- Prohibited/Discouraged CWEs: ingestion metadata (status field) or `config/cwe_filter.yaml`
- Confidence weights: configurable in ConfidenceCalculator constructor
- Rate limiting: 10 relationship queries per minute per session

### Testing Standards

#### Testing Framework Integration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Unit Testing:** Pytest for all new processing modules
- Test individual confidence calculation, filtering, explanation building
- Mock external dependencies (database, API calls)
- Location: `apps/chatbot/tests/unit/test_[module_name].py`

**Integration Testing:** Test component interactions with existing RAG pipeline
- Test confidence scoring integration with query handler
- Test explanation generation with response generator
- Location: `apps/chatbot/tests/integration/`

**E2E Testing:** Playwright for Chainlit UI testing
- Extend existing `test_retrieval_full.py` for confidence score validation
- Add relationship exploration workflow tests
- Location: `apps/chatbot/tests/e2e/`

#### Security Testing Requirements
**Input Validation:** All new modules must use existing InputSanitizer for user inputs
**Information Disclosure:** Confidence scores and explanations must not expose system internals
**Query Injection:** Relationship queries must be validated against injection attacks
**Performance:** New features must not impact response times beyond 5 seconds threshold

### Threat Considerations

**Attack Surfaces:**
- Confidence scoring calculations could expose internal scoring logic
- Explanation generation might leak system prompts or processing details
- Relationship queries could be manipulated for information disclosure

**Threat Scenarios:**
- Malicious users attempting to reverse-engineer confidence scoring algorithms
- Query injection through relationship exploration features
- Information leakage through detailed explanations

**Required Security Controls:**
- Input sanitization for all new query types (relationship, improvement requests)
- Output filtering to prevent system information disclosure in explanations
- Rate limiting on complex relationship queries to prevent DoS

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Use existing InputSanitizer for all user inputs
- Implement explanation content filtering to remove system-specific details
- Add confidence score normalization to prevent algorithm reverse-engineering

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:** `apps/chatbot/tests/` with subdirectories for unit, integration, e2e
**Testing Frameworks:** Pytest for backend, Playwright for E2E UI testing
**Security Testing:** Integrated security validation for input sanitization and output filtering
**Performance Testing:** Response time validation to ensure <5 second threshold maintenance
