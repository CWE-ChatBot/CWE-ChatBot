# Story 3.1: Implement Advanced User Input & Context Preservation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** cybersecurity professional,
**I want** to provide detailed vulnerability information to the chatbot using various formats, and have my conversational context preserved,
**so that** I can get accurate, ongoing analysis without re-entering data.

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Input & Context Preservation
1. **AC1:** The ChatBot supports common and flexible input patterns, including directly pasting vulnerability descriptions, CVE advisories, and tool outputs into the chat interface (NFR27), **verifiable by submitting various input types locally.**
2. **AC2:** The ChatBot provides a secure mechanism for users to submit code snippets or documentation files for analysis (FR25), **verifiable through local file submission tests confirming secure handling and rejection of unsafe inputs.**
3. **AC3:** When configured in no-egress mode, user data does not leave the deployment boundary. In standard mode with external APIs, user content isolation is maintained through evidence chunking without direct prompt injection (FR19, NFR33), **verifiable through DATA_EGRESS_MODE configuration testing and evidence isolation validation.**
4. **AC4:** A user's conversational context (e.g., previously discussed CWEs, chosen role, follow-up questions) is preserved throughout a single session and, optionally, across multiple user sessions (NFR35), **verifiable through local session testing in the Chainlit UI.**
5. **AC5:** The system defines and gracefully enforces size limits on submitted text and code to prevent abuse and manage performance (NFR32), **verifiable by attempting to submit oversized inputs locally.**

### Contextual Retrieval & Follow-ups
6. **AC6:** When a CWE is successfully identified from a query, the system retrieves and presents comprehensive information (e.g., full description, common consequences, relationships to other CWEs or categories) from the vector database (NFR19), **verifiable by local queries that return expected structured data.**
7. **AC7:** The system can understand and respond accurately to simple follow-up questions that are directly related to the previously discussed CWE context (e.g., "What are its common consequences?", "Give me an example", "How does this relate to X?"), **verifiable through interactive local testing in the Chainlit UI.**
8. **AC8:** Responses include source-anchored snippets with provenance information showing supporting chunk ID and CWE section reference, **verifiable by checking response citations against source CWE data.**
9. **AC9:** The ChatBot can respond to queries asking for "similar CWEs" by retrieving and listing related CWEs identified within the corpus (FR6).
10. **AC10:** For detailed information, the ChatBot initially provides a concise answer or summary, with an explicit option or prompt for the user to request more in-depth details (FR5, NFR21).

### Role-Based Context & Hallucination Mitigation
11. **AC11:** The ChatBot explicitly prompts the user to select their role (e.g., PSIRT member, Developer, Academic Researcher, Bug Bounty Hunter, Product Manager) at the start of a new session, or provides a command/option to change role during a session (FR4).
12. **AC12:** For a given CWE, the system can dynamically tailor its response content and emphasis based on the selected role (e.g., for Developers, prioritize code-level remediation steps; for PSIRT, focus on impact, advisory language, and risk assessment details) (FR4), **verifiable by testing different role selections in the Chainlit UI and observing response variations.**
13. **AC13:** Core AI mechanisms are implemented to actively minimize AI hallucination, such as directly citing specific passages from the CWE corpus for critical information or indicating when information is derived rather than directly quoted (NFR6, FR12), **verifiable by local automated tests that flag unexpected or uncited responses for known queries.**
14. **AC14:** The system displays a confidence score or a prioritization order alongside its CWE suggestions or answers (FR15).
15. **AC15:** When the system's confidence in a mapping or a response is low or information is insufficient, it clearly states this limitation and suggests ways the user can refine their query to get a better result (FR17, NFR26), **verifiable through local tests using ambiguous inputs.**

## Security Requirements

**Note:** OAuth 2.0 authentication requirements have been extracted into Story 3.5: OAuth 2.0 Authentication Controls via Chainlit Hooks. This story assumes authenticated users.

1. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation and sanitization of all user inputs including file uploads, text pasting, and form submissions to prevent injection attacks
2. **Data Protection:**
   - Evidence isolation using cl.user_session without direct prompt injection
   - PII masking and secrets redaction in conversation logs
   - Data egress controls via DATA_EGRESS_MODE configuration
3. **Compliance:** GDPR compliance for user conversation data retention and data subject rights
4. **Role Integrity:** User role information must be securely managed within the user's session and cannot be manipulated by user input after being set (except through the official role-change command)
5. **Context Isolation:** The conversational context MUST be strictly isolated to the current user's session. There must be no possibility of one user's context leaking into another's session
6. **Evidence Security:** User-submitted file content must be processed as isolated evidence chunks and cleared from session after response generation
7. **Control Character Filtering:** Strip control characters and neutralize markdown autolinks in user-submitted evidence

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

**Attack Surfaces**:
- File upload endpoints for malicious file injection
- Text input fields susceptible to prompt injection and XSS
- Session storage vulnerable to unauthorized access
- Network traffic exposure in self-hosted environments

**Threat Scenarios**:
- **T-1 Prompt Injection**: Malicious users craft inputs to manipulate LLM behavior or extract system prompts
- **File Upload Attacks**: Upload of malicious files (malware, scripts) to compromise server or extract data
- **Session Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to user conversation context and sensitive data
- **Data Exfiltration**: User-submitted confidential code or vulnerability data leaked to external services

**Required Security Controls**:
- Input sanitization and validation at all entry points using Pydantic models
- File type validation, size limits, and malware scanning for uploads
- Session encryption and proper authentication via OAuth 2.0
- Network isolation and audit logging for data flow monitoring
- Rate limiting and DoS protection for input endpoints

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Implement whitelist-based input validation and content filtering
- Use Google Cloud Storage with encryption and access controls for file storage
- Deploy comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events
- Enforce principle of least privilege for user access controls
