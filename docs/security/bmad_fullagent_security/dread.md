### Detailed Threat Analysis

#### Critical Risk Threats (Score $8.0+$)
* **D-3 - Financial Denial of Service (FDoS) (Score: 9.0):** (D:10, R:9, E:8, A:10, D:8) - Existential business risk from budget exhaustion. Easily automated and affects all users by shutting down the service.
* **T-1 - Prompt Injection Attack (Score: 8.8):** (D:8, R:9, E:9, A:8, D:10) - High damage from system logic manipulation. Trivial to exploit and highly discoverable, affecting the integrity of the entire platform.
* **R-3 - Lack of Verifiable Logs in Self-Hosted Model (Score: 8.8):** (D:4, R:10, E:10, A:10, D:10) - While direct damage is lower, the complete inability to verify or investigate abuse of the self-hosted software is a critical business and liability risk. It's inherent to the feature and perfectly exploitable/discoverable by the user.
* **E-1 - Role Escalation via API Parameter Tampering (Score: 8.6):** (D:10, R:10, E:7, A:10, D:6) - Catastrophic damage from a full admin compromise. The attack is highly reproducible and affects all users.
* **I-4 - Sensitive RAG Context Disclosure to BYO Endpoint (Score: 8.4):** (D:9, R:10, E:7, A:7, D:9) - Potential for a major, system-wide data breach if the RAG DB is ever contaminated with non-public data. Perfectly reproducible and easily discovered by the malicious user.
* **I-2 - System Prompt Extraction (Score: 8.4):** (D:6, R:9, E:9, A:8, D:10) - While direct damage is moderate, the extreme ease of discovery and exploitation makes this a critical threat, undermining the system's intellectual property and security for all users.
* **D-2 - API Flooding (Score: 8.2):** (D:6, R:9, E:8, A:10, D:8) - A classic DoS attack that is easy to execute with standard tools and affects all users by making the service unavailable.
* **R-1 - Insufficient Auditing of Critical Actions (Score: 8.0):** (D:5, R:9, E:9, A:10, D:7) - Missing logs for security-critical events is a severe gap that cripples incident response. The vulnerability (a missing line of code) is easy to create and affects the security of all users.
* **I-1 - Verbose Error Messages (Score: 8.0):** (D:4, R:9, E:9, A:10, D:8) - Trivial to discover and exploit. While direct damage is low, it provides reconnaissance that facilitates more severe attacks, thus affecting the security of the whole system.

#### High Risk Threats (Score $6.0 - 7.9$)
* **E-2 - LLM Function-Calling Abuse (Score: 7.8):** (D:10, R:9, E:6, A:10, D:4) - Catastrophic damage, but harder to discover and exploit than direct API tampering.
* **I-3 - Cross-User Data Leakage (IDOR) (Score: 7.6):** (D:8, R:9, E:7, A:7, D:7) - A classic, high-impact web vulnerability causing a significant privacy breach.
* **S-3 - Malicious "Bring Your Own" (BYO) LLM Endpoint (Score: 7.4):** (D:8, R:10, E:7, A:3, D:9) - High damage potential to the individual user, and perfectly reproducible by the attacker.
* **D-1 - Resource Exhaustion via Complex AI Queries (Score: 7.4):** (D:6, R:8, E:7, A:9, D:7) - A significant availability risk that is moderately easy to exploit.
* **T-3 & S-2 - Unauthorized Config Change & OAuth Interception (Score: 6.4):** Classic web vulnerabilities that can lead to account takeover or horizontal privilege escalation.
* **R-2, S-1, T-2 - Log Tampering, Session Hijacking, Data Poisoning (Scores: 6.0-6.2):** Significant threats that are harder to execute due to requiring pre-existing high privileges or specific network conditions (MitM).

#### Medium Risk Threats (Score $4.0 - 5.9$)
* **E-3 - Application-to-Host Privilege Escalation (Score: 5.8):** (D:10, R:3, E:3, A:10, D:3) - The damage is maximal, but the attack is very difficult to discover and exploit, requiring a separate, severe RCE vulnerability.

### Risk Priorities and Recommendations

This assessment provides a clear, data-driven roadmap for mitigation.

**Immediate Action Required (Critical - Score $8.0+$):**
1.  **Financial/API DoS (D-3, D-2):** Implement strict rate limiting and cloud billing alerts immediately.
2.  **Prompt Injection (T-1, I-2):** Implement and continuously refine strong input/output guardrails for the LLM.
3.  **Authorization Flaws (E-1, I-1):** Harden the API against parameter tampering and ensure production environments disable verbose errors.
4.  **BYO Feature Risks (I-4, R-3):** Enforce the "public data only" rule for the RAG DB. Add clear terms of service regarding the user's responsibility in the self-hosted model.
5.  **Logging (R-1):** Ensure the audit trail for critical events is implemented as a top priority.

**High Priority (Score $6.0-7.9$):**
1.  **LLM Tooling (E-2):** Before implementing any LLM function-calling, design and build a robust permission model.
2.  **Web Vulnerabilities (I-3, S-1, S-2, T-3):** Prioritize secure coding and testing to eliminate classic vulnerabilities like IDOR and session management flaws.
3.  **Data & Log Integrity (T-2, R-2):** Implement file integrity checks in the ingestion pipeline and harden IAM permissions for log storage.
4.  **Availability (D-1):** Implement query complexity analysis and timeouts.
