## GDPR Compliance Audit Report: CWE ChatBot

### Audit Date: 2025-07-23

### Assessed By: Chris (Security Agent)

### Executive Summary

The CWE ChatBot project demonstrates a **strong foundation for GDPR compliance by design**. The architecture and requirements proactively address core data protection principles, including data minimization, encryption, secure authentication, and mechanisms to support data subject rights.

The overall architectural design is **compliant**. However, full operational compliance requires the formalization of specific procedural documents, primarily an Incident Response Plan for breach notifications and a formal Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

### Detailed Compliance Analysis

| GDPR Principle / Requirement | Relevant Project Controls & Requirements | Compliance Status | Findings & Recommendations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lawful Basis for Processing** (Art. 6) | User authentication (OAuth) and storage of conversation history is necessary for the performance of the service the user signs up for. | ✅ **Compliant** | The implied legal basis is sound. Ensure the Terms of Service clearly state what data is processed and why. |
| **Data Subject Rights** (Chapter 3) | - **Access/Portability:** FR22/NFR45 (Export history).\<br\>- **Erasure:** `ON DELETE CASCADE` in DB schema.\<br\>- **Rectification:** `/user/config` API endpoint. | ✅ **Compliant** | The technical foundations to fulfill data subject rights are well-architected. These should be exposed to users via the UI. |
| **Data Protection by Design** (Art. 25) | Security-first architecture, passwordless auth, data minimization noted in security docs, encryption at rest/transit (NFR33, NFR4). | ✅ **Compliant** | Excellent. Security and privacy were clearly considered from the start, which is the essence of this principle. |
| **Security of Processing** (Art. 32) | Comprehensive security NFRs (NFR4-11, 47), Threat Model, DREAD assessment, and resulting Security Requirements (SR1-15). | ✅ **Compliant** | The project has a robust and detailed plan for securing data processing activities. |
| **Data Breach Notification** (Art. 33, 34) | Strong logging and monitoring defined (NFR11, NFR40). Architecture review recommended a formal IR plan. | ⚠️ **Partial / Gap** | **Finding:** The system is designed with the necessary logging to *detect* a breach, but a formal Incident Response (IR) plan detailing the *procedure* for notification within the 72-hour GDPR timeframe is not yet documented. |
| **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** (Art. 35)| The project handles potentially sensitive user code and PII, with advanced AI processing and BYO features. | ⚠️ **Partial / Gap** | **Finding:** Given the nature of the data processed, a formal DPIA is required. Our threat modeling and risk assessment work serves as a critical input, but a dedicated DPIA document should be created to formalize this process. |
| **Cross-Border Data Transfers** (Chapter 5) | Architecture specifies deployment to specific GCP regions to manage data residency. | ✅ **Compliant** | The design correctly considers data residency. Ensure that if any cross-border transfers occur (e.g., to an LLM API in another region), appropriate legal mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are in place. |

### Summary of Gaps & Recommendations

The project is in a very good state regarding GDPR. To achieve full operational compliance, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Develop a Formal Incident Response Plan:** Create a dedicated IR document that outlines the step-by-step procedure for responding to a potential data breach. This plan must include steps for investigation, containment, and notifying the relevant supervisory authority within the 72-hour timeframe required by GDPR.
2.  **Conduct and Document a formal DPIA:** Before going live, a Data Protection Impact Assessment should be formally conducted and documented. This process will leverage the threat model we have already created to analyze risks to data subjects and ensure necessary mitigations are in place.
