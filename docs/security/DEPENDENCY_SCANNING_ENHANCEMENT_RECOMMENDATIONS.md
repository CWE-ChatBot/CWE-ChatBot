---

## Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. Add Container Image Scanning with Trivy ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Gap**: Docker base images are SHA256-pinned (excellent!) but not actively scanned for vulnerabilities in CI/CD.

**Recommendation**: Add Trivy container scanning to detect vulnerabilities in base images.

#### Implementation

**Add to `.github/workflows/quality.yml`:**

```yaml
# === Trivy Container Scanning ===
trivy-container:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install Trivy
      run: |
        wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
        echo "deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install trivy

    - name: Scan chatbot Dockerfile base image
      run: |
        # Extract SHA256 digest from Dockerfile
        BASE_IMAGE=$(grep "^FROM python:3.11-slim@sha256:" apps/chatbot/Dockerfile | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
        echo "Scanning base image: $BASE_IMAGE"
        trivy image \
          --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \
          --format sarif \
          --output trivy-chatbot-base.sarif \
          "$BASE_IMAGE"

    - name: Scan pdf_worker Dockerfile base image
      run: |
        BASE_IMAGE=$(grep "^FROM python:3.11-slim@sha256:" apps/pdf_worker/Dockerfile | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
        echo "Scanning base image: $BASE_IMAGE"
        trivy image \
          --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \
          --format sarif \
          --output trivy-pdf-worker-base.sarif \
          "$BASE_IMAGE"

    - name: Upload Trivy SARIF to Code Scanning (chatbot)
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      with:
        sarif_file: trivy-chatbot-base.sarif
        category: trivy-chatbot-base

    - name: Upload Trivy SARIF to Code Scanning (pdf_worker)
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      with:
        sarif_file: trivy-pdf-worker-base.sarif
        category: trivy-pdf-worker-base

    - name: Fail if HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities found
      run: |
        trivy image \
          --severity HIGH,CRITICAL \
          --exit-code 1 \
          "$(grep "^FROM python:3.11-slim@sha256:" apps/chatbot/Dockerfile | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')"
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Detect vulnerabilities in base images (even with SHA256 pinning)
- ✅ Alert when pinned base image becomes vulnerable
- ✅ Prompt SHA256 digest updates when CVEs are disclosed
- ✅ SARIF integration with GitHub Security tab

**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Add Safety Scanner as Backup ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Rationale**: Defense-in-depth - use multiple vulnerability databases for broader coverage.

**Current**: pip-audit uses PyPI Advisory Database
**Enhancement**: Add Safety (uses PyUp.io database) for broader CVE coverage

#### Implementation

**Add to `.github/workflows/quality.yml`:**

```yaml
# === Safety Dependency Scanner (Backup) ===
safety:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'

    - name: Install Poetry
      run: curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

    - name: Ensure Poetry on PATH
      run: echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

    - name: Install Poetry export plugin
      run: poetry self add poetry-plugin-export

    - name: Export deps from Poetry
      run: poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes -o requirements.txt

    - name: Install Safety
      run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip safety

    - name: Run Safety scan
      id: safety
      continue-on-error: true
      run: |
        set +e
        safety check --file requirements.txt --json --output safety-report.json
        echo "exit_code=$?" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        exit 0

    - name: Upload Safety report
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: safety-report.json
        path: safety-report.json

    - name: Parse and display Safety findings
      if: always()
      run: |
        python - <<'PY'
        import json, sys
        try:
            with open("safety-report.json") as f:
                data = json.load(f)
            vulns = data.get("vulnerabilities", [])
            if vulns:
                print(f"\n🟡 Safety found {len(vulns)} vulnerability/vulnerabilities:\n")
                for v in vulns:
                    print(f"  • {v.get('package_name')} {v.get('vulnerable_spec')}")
                    print(f"    CVE: {v.get('cve', 'N/A')}")
                    print(f"    Severity: {v.get('severity', 'UNKNOWN')}")
                    print(f"    {v.get('advisory', '')}\n")
                print("⚠️  Review Safety findings. May overlap with pip-audit.")
            else:
                print("✅ Safety found no additional vulnerabilities.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️  Could not parse Safety report: {e}")
        PY

    # Don't fail build - informational only (pip-audit is authoritative)
    - name: Report Safety status
      run: |
        if [ "${{ steps.safety.outputs.exit_code }}" != "0" ]; then
          echo "::warning::Safety found vulnerabilities. Review safety-report.json artifact."
        fi
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Broader CVE coverage (PyUp.io + PyPI databases)
- ✅ Earlier detection of emerging vulnerabilities
- ✅ Cross-validation of pip-audit findings

**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM (informational, doesn't block builds)

---

### 3. Add Dependabot Alerts Integration ⭐ LOW PRIORITY

**Current**: You have `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` workflow (line 3 from glob results)
**Enhancement**: Ensure Dependabot is configured to scan Poetry dependencies

#### Implementation

**Verify/Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:**

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Python dependencies via Poetry
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-request-limit: 5
    # Automatically label security updates
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
    # Group non-security updates
    groups:
      dev-dependencies:
        patterns:
          - "pytest*"
          - "black"
          - "ruff"
          - "mypy"
          - "bandit"

  # GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "ci"

  # Docker base images
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/apps/chatbot"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "docker"

  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/apps/pdf_worker"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "docker"
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automated PRs for vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ GitHub Security Advisories integration
- ✅ Automated merging with `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`

**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Priority**: LOW (nice-to-have, pip-audit already covers this)

---

### 4. Scheduled Dependency Audits ⭐ LOW PRIORITY

**Enhancement**: Add scheduled weekly scans even without code changes

#### Implementation

**Add to `.github/workflows/quality.yml`:**

```yaml
name: quality

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Mondays at 8 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 8 * * 1'
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggering

# ... rest of workflow
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Detect new CVEs disclosed for existing dependencies
- ✅ Proactive security posture
- ✅ Weekly security health check

**Effort**: 5 minutes (add 3 lines to workflow)
**Priority**: LOW (current on-commit scanning is sufficient)

---

### 5. CVE Notification Configuration ⭐ INFORMATIONAL

**Enhancement**: Configure GitHub notifications for Security Alerts

#### Steps (Manual Configuration)

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings > Code security and analysis**
2. **Enable**:
   - ✅ Dependabot alerts
   - ✅ Dependabot security updates
   - ✅ Code scanning (already enabled via SARIF uploads)
3. **Configure Notifications**:
   - Go to Profile > Settings > Notifications
   - Enable "Security alerts" for the repository
   - Choose notification method (email, Slack, etc.)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Immediate notification of new CVEs
- ✅ Centralized security alert dashboard
- ✅ Integration with GitHub Security tab

**Effort**: 10 minutes (one-time setup)
**Priority**: INFORMATIONAL
