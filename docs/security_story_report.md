## Security Story Report

### Introduction
This report contains a prioritized set of security-focused user stories derived from the STRIDE threat model and DREAD risk assessment. Each story is designed to be an actionable work item for the development team, complete with testable acceptance criteria to guide implementation and validation.

### Critical Priority Stories

#### Security Story 1: Implement API Rate Limiting and Budget Monitoring
* **Threats Mitigated:** D-3 (Financial DoS), D-2 (API Flooding)
* **User Story:** As a **System Administrator**, I want **robust rate limiting on all public endpoints and configurable billing alerts**, so that **the service is protected from denial-of-service attacks and financial exhaustion.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  A default rate limit (e.g., 60 requests per minute) is applied to all chat and API endpoints on a per-user and/or per-IP basis.
    2.  Any request exceeding the defined limit is rejected with a standard `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error response.
    3.  The specific rate limit values are configurable via environment variables for each environment (staging, production).
    4.  GCP billing alerts are configured via Terraform to send a notification to an administrator's email when projected costs exceed predefined daily and monthly thresholds.
    5.  Automated integration tests are written to verify that the rate limit is correctly enforced and that exceeding it returns a `429` error.

#### Security Story 2: Implement LLM Input/Output Guardrails
* **Threats Mitigated:** T-1 (Prompt Injection), I-2 (System Prompt Extraction)
* **User Story:** As a **Security Engineer**, I want **all user input to be sanitized before being sent to the LLM and all LLM output to be validated before being displayed**, so that **prompt injection and system prompt leaking attacks are prevented.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  A Python module for input sanitization is created to detect and neutralize common prompt injection patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "act as...", etc.).
    2.  All user-provided chat messages are processed by this input sanitization module before being used in an LLM prompt.
    3.  An output validation module is created to scan LLM responses for keywords or patterns that match the confidential system prompt.
    4.  If a potential system prompt leak is detected in an LLM response, the response is blocked, a generic error message is returned to the user, and the event is logged.
    5.  Any detected prompt injection attempt (on input or output) is logged as a "CRITICAL" security event with the full payload for analysis.
    6.  Unit tests are created for the guardrail modules that verify their effectiveness against a list of known prompt injection attack strings.

#### Security Story 3: Harden API Authorization and Access Control
* **Threats Mitigated:** E-1 (Role Escalation), I-3 (Cross-User Data Leakage / IDOR), T-3 (Unauthorized Config Change)
* **User Story:** As a **Security Engineer**, I want **every API endpoint to enforce strict, ownership-based authorization**, so that **users can only access or modify their own data and cannot escalate their privileges.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  A reusable authorization decorator or middleware is created in the Python backend.
    2.  This middleware is applied to all API endpoints that handle user-specific resources (e.g., `/user/config`, `/conversations/{id}`).
    3.  The middleware verifies that the `user_id` from the authenticated session token matches the `user_id` associated with the resource being requested from the database.
    4.  The logic for the `/user/config` endpoint explicitly ignores or rejects any `role` or other privileged fields present in the incoming request payload.
    5.  Automated integration tests verify that User A, when authenticated, receives a `403 Forbidden` or `404 Not Found` error when attempting to GET or PUT data belonging to User B.
    6.  Any failed authorization attempt is logged as a "HIGH" priority security event.

#### Security Story 4: Implement Comprehensive and Secure Audit Logging
* **Threats Mitigated:** R-1 (Insufficient Auditing), R-2 (Log Tampering), R-3 (Self-host Accountability)
* **User Story:** As an **Incident Responder**, I want **all security-critical events to be logged in a structured, tamper-resistant format**, so that **I can effectively investigate security incidents and ensure user accountability.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  A centralized logging module is implemented that outputs structured JSON logs to Google Cloud Logging.
    2.  The following events are logged with a "SECURITY" tag: login success, login failure, BYO endpoint change (with old/new values), role change, and any event from the guardrails (Story 2).
    3.  All security logs include the authenticated `user_id`, source IP address, timestamp, and a detailed event description.
    4.  The production GCP log bucket is configured with a retention policy and IAM permissions that restrict deletion, helping to mitigate log tampering (**R-2**).
    5.  Documentation for the self-hosted model clearly states the user's responsibility for securing their own logs and includes a recommended logging configuration (**addresses R-3**).

### High Priority Stories

#### Security Story 5: Harden Session and Authentication Flow
* **Threats Mitigated:** S-1 (User Session Hijacking), S-2 (OAuth Flow Interception)
* **User Story:** As a **Security Engineer**, I want to **implement standard security best practices for session management and the OAuth 2.0 flow**, so that **user accounts are protected from hijacking and impersonation.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  All session cookies are configured with the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags to protect against theft.
    2.  A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented on all web responses to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that could lead to token theft.
    3.  The OAuth 2.0 implementation strictly validates that the `redirect_uri` in any incoming request exactly matches one of the URIs in a pre-configured server-side allow-list.
    4.  The OAuth 2.0 `state` parameter is cryptographically generated, used, and validated on every authorization request to prevent CSRF on the login flow.
    5.  Automated tests are created to verify the presence of secure cookie flags, the CSP header, and the correct rejection of invalid `redirect_uri` values.

#### Security Story 6: Secure and Sanitize BYO LLM Endpoint Interactions
* **Threats Mitigated:** S-3 (Malicious "Bring Your Own" LLM Endpoint)
* **User Story:** As a **Security Engineer**, I want the system to **treat all user-configured "Bring Your Own" LLM endpoints as untrusted external services**, so that **malicious responses cannot be used to attack the user or the system.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  All network requests from the backend to a BYO LLM endpoint must be made through a sandboxed egress proxy that enforces strict network policies (e.g., preventing SSRF attacks against internal GCP services).
    2.  The response body received from a BYO LLM endpoint is sanitized to remove potentially malicious content (e.g., `<script>` tags, dangerous HTML) before being processed or displayed in the UI.
    3.  A clear, persistent warning is displayed in the UI whenever a user is interacting via a custom, non-default LLM.
    4.  Documentation explicitly warns users about the security and privacy risks of using untrusted third-party LLM endpoints.
    5.  Automated tests verify that a response containing malicious HTML/script content from a mock BYO endpoint is properly sanitized before rendering.

#### Security Story 7: Implement Application Resiliency against Complex Queries
* **Threats Mitigated:** D-1 (Resource Exhaustion via Complex AI Queries)
* **User Story:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to **implement strict timeouts and complexity limits on AI-driven queries**, so that **a single malicious user cannot degrade service performance for all legitimate users.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  A hard timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) is implemented for the entire RAG and LLM response generation process.
    2.  Any query exceeding the timeout is terminated gracefully, the event is logged, and a user-friendly error message is returned.
    3.  A pre-processing mechanism is implemented to analyze query complexity (e.g., based on length or token count) and reject queries that are excessively large before they are sent to the LLM.
    4.  The timeout and complexity limit values are configurable via environment variables.
    5.  Automated tests are created to prove that overly long-running or complex queries are correctly terminated or rejected.

#### Security Story 8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data
* **Threats Mitigated:** **T1 (Memory Poisoning)**, T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)
* **User Story:** As a **Data Engineer**, I want to **verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process**, so that **the application's core knowledge base cannot be poisoned with malicious information.**
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
    1.  The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.
    2.  If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data.
    3.  If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.
    4.  The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.
