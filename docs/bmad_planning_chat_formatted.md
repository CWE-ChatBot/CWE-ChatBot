# BMad Planning Chat - User vs LLM Formatted

## Formatting Guide
- **USER INPUT**: Highlighted with `> ` prefix
- **LLM RESPONSE**: Regular text with agent context clearly marked
- **CLEAN FORMAT**: BMad interface markers removed for clarity

> **USER:** pm create-doc prd

**LLM (BMAD PM Agent):**

Alright, let's get started on that Product Requirements Document (PRD).

I'll be using the `prd-tmpl.yaml` template to guide us.

First things first, what mode would you prefer for creating this document?

1. **Interactive Mode**: We'll go through each section collaboratively, step-by-step.
2. **YOLO Mode**: I'll generate a complete draft for your review and refinement.

Also, do you have an existing **Project Brief** document available? It provides essential foundational information like the problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, and constraints.

> **USER:** interactive mode. I do not have an existing Project Brief document but would like to create one

**LLM (BMAD PM Agent):**

Got it. We'll proceed in Interactive Mode for the PRD.

You're making a wise choice by wanting to create a Project Brief first, as it really lays a solid foundation for the PRD.

Given that a Project Brief is best handled by our Business Analyst, I recommend we switch roles for a moment. Would you like me to transform into the Analyst to help you create that Project Brief? This will ensure we get all those essential details like the problem statement, target users, and MVP scope sorted out first.

> **USER:** yes, transform into the Analyst to help you create that Project Brief

**LLM (BMAD Analyst):**

Alright! Transforming into Mary, the Business Analyst now. You've got a keen eye for strategy, and I'm ready to help you outline your vision.

I'm now active as your Business Analyst. Let's get that Project Brief started!

To begin, what mode would you prefer for creating this Project Brief?

1. **Interactive Mode** - We'll work through each section collaboratively.
2. **YOLO Mode** - I'll generate a complete draft for your review and refinement.

Let me know which option works best for you!

> **USER:** Interactive Mode

**LLM (BMAD Analyst):**

Excellent. We'll build this Project Brief together in Interactive Mode.

Let's start with the Executive Summary. This section provides a high-level overview of your project.

To begin, could you please tell me:

* What is the **name** of your project or product?
* What is the **primary problem** your project aims to solve, in one or two sentences?
* Who is your **target market**?
* What is the **key value proposition** of your solution?

> **USER:** 
> ```
> name: CWE ChatBot
> 
> primary problem your project aims to solve: allow users to interact with the CWE corpus as opposed to simply search or browse it.
> 
> See user scenarios that describe the problems, target users and value proposition
> 
> ## 1. User Scenarios
> 
> ### 1.1 PSIRT Member Writing a Vulnerability Advisory
> 
> * **Available information:** Collection of bug reports and issue summaries; access to developers
> * **Background knowledge:** General vulnerability types, programming concepts
> * **Time pressure:** High
> * **Correctness vs. completeness:** Needs accurate CWE IDs; may prioritize speed when multiple weaknesses exist
> 
> ### 1.2 Developer Fixing a Vulnerability
> 
> * **Available information:** Source code, mistake and patch details, bug reports, tradeoff discussions, testing results, proof-of-concept code
> * **Background knowledge:** Programming languages, protocols, tech stacks, bug remediation
> * **Time pressure:** High
> * **Correctness importance:** Lower (primary focus on fixing bugs/features)
> * **Special consideration:** Developer may receive CWE IDs from external reports or tools
> 
> ### 1.3 Academic Vulnerability Researcher
> 
> * **Available information:** May lack source code or patch; research focus varies (single weakness class, technology-specific, detection methods)
> * **Background knowledge:** Varies with research orientation; deeper source understanding for exploit reliability
> * **Time pressure:** Low
> * **Correctness importance:** Moderate
> 
> ### 1.4 Bug Bounty Hunter Reporting Vulnerabilities
> 
> * **Available information:** May lack source code or patch; exploit writing may require deep technical insight
> * **Background knowledge:** Varies by attacker focus
> * **Time pressure:** Low
> * **Correctness importance:** Moderate
> 
> ### 1.5 Product Manager Preventing Weaknesses at Scale
> 
> * **Goal:** Identify common CWE patterns across products to guide large-scale remediation and prevention efforts
> * **Constraints:** Balances strategic planning with resource allocation

*Note: This is a sample of the formatted structure. The full chat would continue with this pattern, clearly distinguishing between user input (with `>` prefix) and LLM responses (with agent markers and structured formatting).*

## Processing Instructions

To fully format the original chat file, I would need to:

1. **Identify User Input Patterns**: Text that appears before "B BMAD full stack Custom Gem Show thinking" markers
2. **Identify LLM Response Patterns**: Text that follows the agent markers
3. **Apply Consistent Formatting**: Use blockquotes for user input, code blocks or regular text for LLM responses
4. **Preserve Agent Context**: Maintain information about which BMad agent (PM, Analyst, Architect, etc.) is responding

Would you like me to process the full file using this format pattern?
