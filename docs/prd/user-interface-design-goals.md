# User Interface Design Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision for the CWE ChatBot, guiding our design and frontend development efforts to ensure a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision for the CWE ChatBot is to provide an intuitive, efficient, and trustworthy conversational interface for accessing and understanding complex CWE information. The experience should feel like interacting with a knowledgeable and helpful expert, not a rigid database. Users should feel empowered to find answers quickly and confidently, with minimal friction.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

  * **Conversational Interface First:** The primary interaction will be via a chat window, allowing natural language input and output.
  * **Progressive Disclosure:** Information will be revealed incrementally, starting with concise answers and offering deeper dives upon request, to avoid overwhelming the user.
  * **Contextual Adaptability:** The UI will subtly adapt, or display indicators, based on the user's role (e.g., developer, PSIRT member) to tailor the presentation of information.
  * **Actionable Feedback:** Clear and immediate feedback will be provided for user actions, system processing, and confidence levels of responses.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens/views for delivering the ChatBot's value include:

  * **Main Chat Interface:** The central conversational window where users input queries and receive responses.
  * **Settings/Profile Page:** For managing user preferences, perhaps authentication details, and potentially viewing chat history.
  * **Feedback/Report Issue Module:** A discreet mechanism within the chat interface for users to report inaccuracies or provide suggestions.
  * **Onboarding/Introduction Screen:** A brief, guided tour for new users to understand the ChatBot's capabilities and best practices for interaction.
  * **Detailed User Flow Documentation:** For each critical user journey spanning these core screens, detailed user flow diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid) explicitly mapping steps, decision points, and error handling will be created and maintained as a mandatory output in the **UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec.md`) by the UX Expert**.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

We will aim for **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**. This includes considerations for:

  * **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
  * **Color Contrast:** Meeting minimum contrast ratios for text and graphical elements.
  * **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Providing proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for assistive technologies.
  * **Text Resizing:** Ensuring content is readable when text is scaled up to 200%.

## Branding

The ChatBot's visual identity should align with a professional, clean, and trustworthy aesthetic. It should evoke confidence and reliability, avoiding overly playful or distracting elements. Branding elements should facilitate clarity and ease of use, making complex information approachable. If existing organizational branding guidelines are available, they will take precedence.

## Color Palette

We will adopt a palette directly inspired by the official CWE and CVE brand colors, balancing professionalism with clear communication of status and interaction.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--------- | :------- | :---- |
| Primary    | `#4169E1` | Main interactive elements (buttons, links, active states), conveying trust and reliability (based on CWE logo blue). |
| Secondary  | `#8B0000` | Accent color for key highlights, warnings, and emphasis (based on CWE logo outline maroon/red). |
| Accent     | `#FFA500` | Call-to-action elements, success indicators, or attention-grabbing details (based on CVE logo orange). |
| Neutral 1  | `#333333` | Primary text, strong headings. |
| Neutral 2  | `#6c757d` | Secondary text, subtle borders, inactive elements. |
| Background | `#f8f9fa` | Clean, light backgrounds for readability. |
| Success    | `#28a745` | Positive confirmations, successful operations (standard green). |
| Warning    | `#ffc107` | Cautions, important notices (standard yellow/orange, complements Accent). |
| Error      | `#dc3545` | Error messages, destructive actions (standard red). |

## Typography

Clear and legible typography is paramount for conveying technical information effectively.

  * **Font Families:**
      * **Primary:** A modern, highly readable sans-serif font family (e.g., **'Inter'**, 'Roboto', or 'Open Sans') for all body text and UI elements.
      * **Monospace:** A clear, developer-friendly monospace font (e.g., **'Fira Code'**, 'JetBrains Mono', or 'Source Code Pro') for displaying code snippets within chatbot responses.
  * **Type Scale:** A responsive type scale will ensure optimal readability and hierarchy across all screen sizes.

| Element | Size (px, base 16px) | Weight | Line Height (em) |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 (Page Title) | 36 | Bold | 1.2 |
| H2 (Section) | 28 | Semi-Bold | 1.3 |
| H3 (Subsection) | 22 | Medium | 1.4 |
| Body | 16 | Regular | 1.5 |
| Small/Caption | 14 | Regular | 1.4 |

## Iconography

Icons will be used sparingly to enhance clarity and reinforce meaning without clutter.

  * **Icon Library:** A well-established, open-source icon library (e.g., **'Material Icons'** or 'Font Awesome') will be the primary source for standard UI icons.
  * **Usage Guidelines:** Icons should maintain a consistent visual style, stroke weight, and fill. Custom icons will only be created for truly unique functionalities not covered by the chosen library.

## Spacing & Layout

A consistent spacing and layout system will ensure visual harmony and predictable element placement.

  * **Grid System:** While a traditional grid might not apply to the conversational flow, a responsive **fluid grid for supporting views** (e.g., settings pages) will be used.
  * **Spacing Scale:** A base 8-pixel spacing unit will be used to define all margins, padding, and gaps between elements, ensuring visual rhythm and alignment.
