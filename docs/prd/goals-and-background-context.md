# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

  * Revolutionize interaction with the CWE corpus by shifting to a dynamic, interactive conversational interface.
  * Enable PSIRT members to efficiently create vulnerability advisories.
  * Contribute to a 20% decrease in the average Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) for vulnerabilities linked to CWEs for developers by providing faster and more effective access to remediation information within 18 months of launch.
  * Support a 50% increase in the proactive identification of common CWE patterns across product lines by Product Managers through enhanced interactive analysis capabilities within 24 months, leading to actionable prevention strategies.
  * Achieve high user satisfaction rate (CSAT) with the clarity and actionability of chatbot responses within 6 months of launch.

## Background Context

The current methods for engaging with the extensive Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) corpus are largely static, relying on search and browse functions. While comprehensive, this approach creates significant friction for various cybersecurity professionals who require immediate, contextual, and actionable insights to perform their tasks under tight deadlines or for strategic planning. The CWE ChatBot project directly addresses this gap by leveraging conversational AI to provide tailored, dynamic interactions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of vulnerability management and prevention.
