# Epic List

This section outlines the high-level epics that represent significant, deployable increments of functionality for the CWE ChatBot. Each epic is designed to build upon the previous one, delivering tangible value as the project progresses.

  * **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Chatbot Infrastructure**
      * **Goal:** Establish the foundational project setup (monorepo structure), deploy the basic Chainlit application on GCP Cloud Run, and implement the initial pipeline for ingesting and preparing the CWE corpus data **for effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This epic aims to deliver a "hello world" chatbot that can respond with simple, static CWE information, validating the core technical stack.
  * **Epic 2: Core Conversational & Contextual Intelligence**
      * **Goal:** Implement robust NLU and the **core Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process**, including advanced information retrieval/synthesis and initial role-based context awareness, to provide accurate and tailored CWE responses. This epic focuses on building the core AI intelligence and minimizing hallucination (FR1-FR6, FR12-FR17).
  * **Epic 3: Enhanced User Interaction & Feedback Loop**
      * **Goal:** Develop features for summarizing/detailing CWEs, suggesting related content, and enabling user feedback, improving the overall interactive experience and chatbot learning.
