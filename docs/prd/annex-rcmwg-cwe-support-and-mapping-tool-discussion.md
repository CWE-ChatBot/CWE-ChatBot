## Possible Use Cases for a “CWE Support” Tool

  * **Root cause mapping:** Helps users accurately map root causes to CWE entries.
  * **Learning assistance:** Guides users in understanding vulnerabilities and conducting root cause analysis.
  * **Weakness comprehension:** Provides explanations of CWE weaknesses, common consequences, and code examples.
  * **Navigational support:** Helps users explore CWE views, hierarchies, and relationships.

## Context of a Root Cause Mapping Assistance Tool

  * Understanding **why** someone would use an LLM or mapping assistance tool.
  * **Factors influencing use:**
      * **Activity:** What the user is doing that requires CWE mapping.
      * **Available Information:** What data the user has for mapping decisions (Slack messages, emails, reports, etc.).
      * **Coding Knowledge:** Skill level and familiarity with vulnerabilities.
      * **Time Pressures:** Urgency of mapping decisions.
      * **Correctness Importance:** How crucial it is to get the mapping correct.
  * Information varies **person-to-person, role-to-role** (e.g., a PSIRT member vs. a developer).
