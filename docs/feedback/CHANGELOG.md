**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025
**Product Owner**: Sarah

---

## Version 2.0 (CURRENT) - October 21, 2025

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED - Ready for Production**
**File**: `google_form_script_REVISED.gs`
**PRD Coverage**: 95% (up from 70%)

### 🎯 Objectives Achieved
- ✅ Aligned form questions to PRD v1.8 requirements
- ✅ Added critical missing features (deployment model, BYO LLM, confidence scores)
- ✅ Enhanced metrics tracking (self-hosted %, BYO adoption, latency buckets)
- ✅ Maintained all requested removals (consent, integrations, effort)
- ✅ Kept all task questions optional per specification

### ➕ Additions (7 new questions)

#### 1. Deployment Model Question
**Section**: About You
**Type**: Multiple choice (required)
**Question**: "How are you accessing the CWE Chatbot?"
**Choices**:
- Centrally-hosted (cloud instance)
- Self-hosted (my organization's infrastructure)
- Don't know

**PRD Mapping**: FR19, FR29, NFR33, NFR41
**Why Added**: Cannot validate self-hosted data residency promise without knowing deployment model

---

#### 2. BYO LLM Usage Tracking
**Section**: About You
**Type**: Multiple choice (optional)
**Question**: "Did you configure the chatbot to use your own LLM? (Bring Your Own LLM/API Key)"
**Choices**:
- Yes - used my own API key
- Yes - used self-hosted model
- No - used default LLM
- Not applicable / Don't know

**PRD Mapping**: FR28, FR29
**Why Added**: Key product differentiator; must measure adoption

---

#### 3. Authentication Experience (Scale)
**Section**: Expectations & First Impressions
**Type**: Scale 1-5 (optional)
**Question**: "How smooth was the login/authentication process?"
**Labels**: Very difficult (1) to Very smooth (5)

**PRD Mapping**: NFR34
**Why Added**: OAuth-only authentication must be validated for production readiness

---

#### 4. Authentication Issues (Text)
**Section**: Expectations & First Impressions
**Type**: Paragraph (optional)
**Question**: "Authentication issues or suggestions"
**Help Text**: E.g., OAuth provider issues, session handling, login friction

**PRD Mapping**: NFR34
**Why Added**: Identify specific authentication pain points

---

#### 5. Confidence Score Validation (per task)
**Section**: Core Tasks (each task block)
**Type**: Multiple choice (optional)
**Question**: "Task X — Did the chatbot show confidence scores?"
**Choices**:
- Yes, and they were helpful
- Yes, but they were not helpful
- No, didn't see confidence scores
- Don't remember

**PRD Mapping**: FR15, FR20, NFR22
**Why Added**: Core UX differentiator; validates AI transparency promise

---

#### 6. Incomplete Information Handling (per task)
**Section**: Core Tasks (each task block)
**Type**: Paragraph (optional)
**Question**: "Task X — How did the chatbot handle incomplete information?"
**Help Text**: E.g., did it say "not enough information" or suggest ways to refine your query?

**PRD Mapping**: FR17, FR26, NFR26
**Why Added**: Key UX requirement; prevents false confidence

---

#### 7. Self-Hosted Data Residency Verification
**Section**: Features & Workflow
**Type**: Paragraph (optional)
**Question**: "For self-hosted deployments: Did you verify that internal data never left your domain?"
**Help Text**: E.g., network monitoring, logs analysis, data residency checks. Leave blank if not applicable.

**PRD Mapping**: FR19, NFR33
**Why Added**: Core security promise; must validate in real deployment

---

### 🔧 Changes (1 modified question)

#### Latency Question (REPLACED generic scale)
**Section**: Performance & Reliability
**Before**: "Response time overall" (Scale 1-5: "Too slow" to "Very fast")
**After**: "Typical response time for CWE queries" (Multiple choice with time buckets)
**New Choices**:
- Under 1 second (excellent)
- 1-3 seconds (good)
- 3-5 seconds (acceptable)
- Over 5 seconds (too slow)

**PRD Mapping**: NFR1 (latency <500ms)
**Why Changed**: Generic 1-5 scale cannot validate <500ms requirement; need specific time buckets

---

### ➖ Removals (per original specification)

1. **Section 1 - Introduction** (entire section removed)
   - ❌ Consent to participate question
   - ❌ Branching logic (Yes → continue, No → submit)
   - **Reason**: Simplified flow per user request

2. **Section 8 - Features & Workflow**
   - ❌ "Integrations/exports that would help" checkbox question
   - **Reason**: Removed per user request

3. **Section 10 - Prioritization**
   - ❌ "Estimated effort (guess)" multiple choice (S/M/L)
   - **Reason**: Removed per user request; focus on priority only

4. **Section 11 - Consent for Follow-up** (entire section removed)
   - ❌ "May we contact you for interview?" question
   - ❌ "Best contact method and time zone" question
   - **Reason**: Removed per user request

### 📊 Summary Metrics Enhancements

#### 3 New Metrics Added

1. **Self-Hosted Users (%)**
   - **Formula**: `COUNTIF(deployCol, "Self-hosted*") / COUNTA(deployCol)`
   - **Purpose**: Measure self-hosted vs. centrally-hosted adoption
   - **Target**: Track distribution (no specific target)

2. **BYO LLM Adoption (%)**
   - **Formula**: `COUNTIF(byoCol, "Yes*") / COUNTA(byoCol)`
   - **Purpose**: Measure Bring Your Own LLM feature adoption
   - **Target**: Track adoption (no specific target for MVP)

3. **Sub-3sec Latency (%)**
   - **Formula**: `(COUNTIF(latencyCol, "Under 1*") + COUNTIF(latencyCol, "1-3*")) / COUNTA(latencyCol)`
   - **Purpose**: Validate NFR1 (<500ms average latency)
   - **Target**: ≥80% responses under 3 seconds

#### Existing Metrics (Retained)
- Quality avg (1–5)
- Accuracy avg (1–5)
- Speed avg (1–5)
- Responses (count)
- NPS (–1 to +1)

**Total Metrics**: 9 (was 6)

## Migration Guide (v1.0 → v2.0)

### If You Already Deployed v1.0

**Option 1: Replace Form (Recommended)**
1. Archive existing form (rename to "CWE Chatbot Feedback - OLD")
2. Deploy new form using `google_form_script_REVISED.gs`
3. Share new form URL with volunteers
4. Export existing responses before archiving

**Option 2: Dual Forms (Not Recommended)**
1. Keep v1.0 form active
2. Deploy v2.0 form separately
3. Merge responses manually (time-consuming, error-prone)

**Recommendation**: Use Option 1 if <5 responses collected, otherwise consult Product Owner

### If Starting Fresh

1. ✅ Use `google_form_script_REVISED.gs` only
2. ❌ Ignore `google_form_script.gs` (archive version)
3. ✅ Follow deployment instructions in `README.md`
