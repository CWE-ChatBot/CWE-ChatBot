# QA Review Fixes - Feedback Form Package
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **All Critical Issues Resolved**

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all fixes applied in response to the QA review of the volunteer feedback package for the centrally-hosted evaluation scope.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed (Blockers)

### ‚úÖ 1. Apps Script Syntax Errors
**Issue**: Unescaped apostrophes in single-quoted strings
**Files Affected**: `google_form_script_REVISED.gs`

**Fixes Applied**:
```javascript
// Line 170: Changed single quotes to double quotes
- 'The chatbot's citations/links improve trust.'
+ "The chatbot's citations/links improve trust."

// Line 159: Changed single quotes to double quotes
- 'File upload isn't available on this form. Paste Drive/issue tracker links instead.'
+ "File upload isn't available on this form. Paste Drive/issue tracker links instead."
```

**Verification**: Script now executes without syntax errors.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Documentation Scope Mismatch (BYO LLM)
**Issue**: Some docs described BYO LLM as available despite centrally-hosted-only scope

**Files Fixed**:
- `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` - Removed BYO LLM section, updated to deployment preference
- `README.md` - Removed BYO LLM references
- `QUESTION_MAPPING_TO_PRD.md` - Marked FR28/FR29 as deferred, removed BYO LLM metric

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed: "BYO LLM Usage Tracking" section
- ‚úÖ Added: "Self-Host Deployment Preference ‚Äî DEFERRED" section
- ‚úÖ Updated: All references now clarify preference only, not actual usage

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Metrics Count Inconsistency
**Issue**: Docs referenced 9 metrics, script produces 7 metrics

**Files Fixed**:
- `README.md` - Changed "9 metrics" ‚Üí "7 metrics"
- `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated metrics table to 7 total
- `QUESTION_MAPPING_TO_PRD.md` - Removed BYO LLM metric row

**Correct Metrics (7 Total)**:
1. Quality avg (1‚Äì5)
2. Accuracy avg (1‚Äì5)
3. Speed avg (1‚Äì5)
4. Responses (count)
5. NPS (‚Äì1 to +1)
6. Prefer Self-Hosted (%)
7. Sub-3sec Latency (%)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Removed Sections Still Referenced
**Issue**: Docs referenced "follow-up consent section" that was removed

**File Fixed**: `VOLUNTEER_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Change**:
```markdown
- **Participate in 15-30 min interview**: Check "Yes" in follow-up consent section
+ **Participate in 15-30 min interview**: Provide your email in the feedback form and we'll reach out
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. PRD Coverage % Conflicts
**Issue**: Docs showed both 95% and 90% coverage

**Files Fixed**: All documentation files

**Standard**:
- **90% PRD Coverage** for centrally-hosted evaluation
- **Deferred to Post-GA**: Self-hosted validation (FR19, NFR33, NFR41), BYO LLM (FR28, FR29)

**Files Updated**:
- `REVISION_SUMMARY.md` - Executive Summary now shows 90%
- `README.md` - "Result: 90% PRD Coverage (up from 70%) for centrally-hosted evaluation"
- `QUESTION_MAPPING_TO_PRD.md` - Status line shows 90%, coverage summary updated

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Missing Question vs Docs
**Issue**: Docs listed "Self-hosted data residency verification" question not in script

**File Fixed**: `QUESTION_MAPPING_TO_PRD.md`

**Change**: Removed data residency verification row entirely (not applicable to centrally-hosted evaluation)

---

## High-Value Improvements Applied

### ‚úÖ 1. Consistent Evaluation Scope Messaging
**All docs now include**:
```markdown
**EVALUATION SCOPE (October 2025)**:
- ‚úÖ **Centrally-hosted deployment ONLY** available for testing
- ‚ùå **Self-hosted and BYO LLM** NOT available (deferred to post-GA)
- üìä **Deployment preference** asked to gauge future interest
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Deployment Preference Clarity
**Updated all references**:
- Changed: "How are you accessing?" ‚Üí "Would you prefer?"
- Changed: "Self-Hosted Users (%)" metric ‚Üí "Prefer Self-Hosted (%)" metric
- Added: Help text clarifying this is PREFERENCE, not actual usage

### ‚úÖ 3. PRD Coverage Symbols
**Introduced consistent notation**:
- ‚úÖ Fully covered in this evaluation
- üìä Partially covered (preference asked, full validation deferred)
- ‚ùå Not covered (out of scope or deferred)
