# Google Form Feedback Script - Product Owner Review & Revision Summary

**Date**: October 2025
**Reviewer**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**PRD Version**: 1.8
**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED WITH CRITICAL REVISIONS**

---

## Executive Summary

The original feedback form covered **70% of PRD requirements** but missed critical features that are key product differentiators:
- Deployment preference tracking (FR19, NFR41)
- Confidence scoring validation (FR15, NFR22)
- Authentication experience (NFR34)
- Specific performance metrics (NFR1)

**Revised script** now covers **90% of PRD requirements** for centrally-hosted evaluation.

**EVALUATION SCOPE (October 2025)**:
- ‚úÖ **Centrally-hosted deployment ONLY** available for testing
- ‚ùå **Self-hosted and BYO LLM** NOT available (deferred to post-GA)
- üìä **Deployment preference** asked to gauge future interest

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ **REMOVALS (Per Original Request)**

| Item | Location | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Consent to participate section | Section 1 | No branching logic needed; simplified flow |
| Integrations/exports question | Section 8 | Removed per user request |
| Estimated effort field | Section 10 | Removed per user request; P0-P3 priority only |
| Consent for follow-up section | Section 11 | Removed per user request |
| Required flags on Core Tasks | Section 4 | Made ALL task fields optional per request |
| Required flags on Prioritization | Section 10 | Made ALL prioritization fields optional |

---

### ‚ûï **CRITICAL ADDITIONS (PRD Alignment)**

#### 1. **Deployment Model Question** (FR19, FR29, NFR33, NFR41)
**Location**: Section "About You"
**Type**: Multiple choice (required)
**Choices**:
- Centrally-hosted (cloud instance)
- Self-hosted (my organization's infrastructure)
- Don't know

**PRD Mapping**:
- **FR19**: "For self-hosted deployments, the ChatBot MUST guarantee that internal confidential information never leaves the user's defined domain"
- **NFR41**: "The system shall be architected as a standalone, deployable application, explicitly designed to support self-hosting"

**Why Critical**: Cannot validate core security promise without knowing deployment model.

---

#### 2. **Self-Host Deployment Preference** (FR19, NFR41) ‚Äî DEFERRED
**Location**: Section "About You"
**Type**: Multiple choice (required)
**Note**: This evaluation uses centrally-hosted deployment only. Question asks about PREFERENCE for future planning.

**PRD Mapping**:
- **FR19**: "For self-hosted deployments, the ChatBot MUST guarantee that internal confidential information never leaves the user's defined domain"
- **NFR41**: "The system shall be architected as a standalone, deployable application, explicitly designed to support self-hosting"

**Status**: Self-hosted validation deferred to post-GA evaluation.

---

#### 3. **Confidence Score Validation** (FR15, FR20, NFR22)
**Location**: Each task block (after "Perceived accuracy")
**Type**: Multiple choice (optional)
**Choices**:
- Yes, and they were helpful
- Yes, but they were not helpful
- No, didn't see confidence scores
- Don't remember

**PRD Mapping**:
- **FR15**: "The ChatBot MUST receive prioritized and confidence-annotated CWE suggestions"
- **NFR22**: "The ChatBot shall present a concise list of prioritized CWE recommendations with confidence scores"

**Why Critical**: Core UX differentiator; validates AI transparency promise.

---

#### 4. **Authentication Experience** (NFR34)
**Location**: Section "Expectations & First Impressions"
**Type**: Scale 1-5 + text feedback
**Questions**:
- "How smooth was the login/authentication process?" (1=Very difficult, 5=Very smooth)
- "Authentication issues or suggestions" (text)

**PRD Mapping**:
- **NFR34**: "The system shall implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access control"

**Current Implementation**: OAuth-only (Google/GitHub)
**Why Critical**: Production readiness depends on authentication usability; no value if users can't log in.

---

#### 5. **Specific Latency Buckets** (NFR1)
**Location**: Section "Performance & Reliability"
**Type**: Multiple choice (required) ‚Äî **REPLACES** generic 1-5 scale
**Choices**:
- Under 1 second (excellent)
- 1-3 seconds (good)
- 3-5 seconds (acceptable)
- Over 5 seconds (too slow)

**PRD Mapping**:
- **NFR1**: "The ChatBot shall deliver responses with an average latency of less than 500ms"

**Why Changed**: Generic "Too slow (1) to Very fast (5)" scale cannot validate <500ms requirement.

---

#### 6. **Incomplete Information Handling** (FR17, FR26, NFR26)
**Location**: Each task block (after "What was missing or wrong?")
**Type**: Text area (optional)
**Question**: "How did the chatbot handle incomplete information?"
**Help Text**: "E.g., did it say 'not enough information' or suggest ways to refine your query?"

**PRD Mapping**:
- **FR17**: "The ChatBot MUST gracefully handle insufficient information (e.g., indicate 'not enough information')"
- **NFR26**: "The ChatBot shall provide guidance for users to refine inputs when suggestions lack confidence"

**Why Critical**: Key UX requirement; prevents user frustration and false confidence.

### üìä **SUMMARY METRICS (7 Total)**

#### Metrics Tracked in Summary Sheet:

| Metric | Formula | PRD Validation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Quality avg (1‚Äì5)** | Average of all task quality scores | Validates NFR6 (hallucination minimization) |
| **Accuracy avg (1‚Äì5)** | Average of all task accuracy scores | Validates FR12 (correct CWE IDs) |
| **Speed avg (1‚Äì5)** | Average of all task speed scores | General performance perception |
| **Responses (count)** | Total response count | Sample size |
| **NPS (‚Äì1 to +1)** | (Promoters - Detractors) / Total | User satisfaction goal |
| **Prefer Self-Hosted (%)** | `COUNTIF(deployCol, "Prefer self-hosted*") / COUNTA(deployCol)` | Measures FR19/NFR41 INTEREST (not actual usage) |
| **Sub-3sec Latency (%)** | `(COUNTIF(latencyCol, "Under 1*") + COUNTIF(latencyCol, "1-3*")) / COUNTA(latencyCol)` | Validates NFR1 (<500ms target) |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Deploy Revised Script** (2 hours)
   - Create new Google Form using `google_form_script_REVISED.gs`
   - Test all questions and summary metrics
   - Share with 1-2 internal testers for dry run

2. **Update Volunteer Instructions** (1 hour)
   - Clarify centrally-hosted evaluation scope
   - Emphasize deployment PREFERENCE question (not actual usage)
   - Include screenshot example for incomplete info handling

3. **Distribute to Volunteers** (Early November per timeline)
   - Target: 20-30 responses (per UX research best practices)
   - Monitor responses weekly
   - Flag P0/P1 items for immediate triage

4. **Analysis & Triage** (Post-collection)
   - Prioritize hallucination reports (High impact first)
   - Review self-hosted deployment interest levels
   - Validate <3sec latency achievement rate
   - Assess confidence score helpfulness
