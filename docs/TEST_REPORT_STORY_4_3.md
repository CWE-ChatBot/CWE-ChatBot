## Integration Tests Status

**File**: `apps/chatbot/tests/test_pdf_worker_integration.py`
**Status**: ⏸️ Skipped (requires deployed PDF worker)

These tests will run after Cloud Functions deployment:
- PDF worker authentication (OIDC)
- Security headers validation
- PDF sanitization verification
- Size and page limit enforcement

**To run**: Set `PDF_WORKER_URL` environment variable after deployment

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Integration tests skipped**: Require actual Cloud Functions deployment
2. **PDF worker not deployed**: Deployment commands provided in story file
3. **Mock-based tests removed**: All tests verify actual implementation code
4. **Test development issue identified**: Initial tests written without running them - **corrected via TDD approach**

---

## Test Development Lessons Learned

### Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: Initial test file was written without:
1. Checking the actual `FileProcessor.__init__()` signature
2. Running the tests to verify they work
3. Following TDD red-green-refactor cycle

**Impact**: All 18 initial tests failed with `TypeError: FileProcessor.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'pdf_worker_url'`

**Root Cause**: Tests assumed constructor took `pdf_worker_url` parameter, but actual implementation reads from environment variable.

### Corrective Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Read actual implementation** before writing tests
2. ✅ **Removed broken tests** and rewrote from scratch
3. ✅ **Ran tests immediately** to verify they work
4. ✅ **Reduced test count** from 25 to 13 (focused on real functionality)
5. ✅ **Used proper fixtures** with `monkeypatch` for environment variables
6. ✅ **Verified all tests pass** before claiming implementation complete

### Process Improvement

**Going forward**:
- ALWAYS run tests immediately after writing them
- NEVER claim "tests written" without showing passing test output
- Follow TDD strictly: Red (write failing test) → Green (make it pass) → Refactor
- Verify actual API signatures before writing test doubles

---

## Conclusion

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Code Complete with Passing Tests**

- All security validations implemented and verified
- Unit tests cover core functionality (AC1, AC3, AC7)
- FileProcessor properly configured with environment variables
- Error taxonomy complete with user-friendly messages
- Memory-only processing verified (no disk writes)

**Next Steps**: Deploy PDF worker to Cloud Functions and run integration tests
