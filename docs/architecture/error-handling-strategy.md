# Error Handling Strategy

This section outlines the comprehensive approach to error detection, handling, logging, and recovery within the CWE ChatBot system, ensuring resilience and clear diagnostics.

## General Approach

  * **Error Model:** The system will adopt a consistent error model across all services, utilizing custom exception classes for anticipated domain-specific errors and standard exceptions for unexpected issues.
  * **Exception Hierarchy:** A structured exception hierarchy will be defined to categorize different types of errors (e.g., `CweNotFoundError`, `InvalidInputError`, `LlmApiError`), allowing for specific handling and clear error propagation.
  * **Error Propagation:** Clear rules will govern how errors are caught, logged, transformed, and re-thrown. External errors will be wrapped or translated into internal, standardized error responses to maintain system consistency.

## Logging Standards

Consistent and comprehensive logging is vital for monitoring, debugging, and auditing.

  * **Library:** Standard Python `logging` module will be used, configured to integrate seamlessly with **Google Cloud Logging** for centralized log aggregation.
  * **Format:** **Structured logging (JSON format)** will be enforced to facilitate easy parsing, filtering, and analysis by monitoring tools.
  * **Levels:** Standard logging levels will be used: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.
  * **Required Context:** All log entries, especially warnings and errors, shall include essential contextual information for traceability and debugging (NFR11, NFR40):
      * `correlation_id`: For tracing a single request or operation across multiple services.
      * `user_id`: (If authenticated) to link errors to specific users.
      * `session_id`: For tracing errors within a specific user's chat session.
      * `service_name` / `module`: To identify the source of the log.
      * `request_id`: For API requests.
  * **Mandatory Security Events:** The following events must be logged with a "SECURITY" tag for auditing (**R-1**):  
    * Login success/failure  
    * BYO endpoint or API key configuration changes (with old/new values, excluding secrets)  
    * User role modifications  
    * Any event triggered by the AI/Prompt Security guardrails (e.g., detected prompt injection)  
    * Any failed authorization attempt (e.g., IDOR attempt)

## Error Handling Patterns

Specific patterns will be applied for different categories of errors to ensure consistent and effective handling.

  * **External API Errors (e.g., LLM APIs, OAuth Providers):**
      * **Retry Policy:** An **exponential backoff with jitter** strategy will be implemented for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary service unavailability, rate limits) when calling external APIs (NFR10).
      * **Circuit Breaker:** For critical external dependencies (e.g., primary LLM provider, Vector Database), a **Circuit Breaker pattern** will be implemented to prevent cascading failures during sustained outages (NFR38).
      * **Timeout Configuration:** Strict and appropriate timeouts will be applied to all outgoing external API calls to prevent indefinite hanging and resource exhaustion.
      * **Error Translation:** External API-specific error codes and messages will be translated into standardized internal error responses (e.g., `LlmApiError`, `OAuthError`) before propagation.
  * **Business Logic Errors:**
      * **Custom Exceptions:** Domain-specific business rule violations (e.g., `CweNotFoundError`, `InvalidInputError`, `UnauthorizedUserRoleError`) will be represented by custom exceptions within the Python application.
      * **User-Facing Errors:** Internal errors will be transformed into clear, concise, and user-friendly messages for display in the chatbot UI, guiding the user on next steps (FR17, FR26). Raw technical details will not be exposed to the user.
      * **Error Codes:** An internal system of error codes might be considered for programmatic handling and consistency across the API (as per REST API Spec).
  * **Data Consistency:**
      * **Transaction Strategy:** Database operations involving multiple statements will be enclosed within **transactions** to ensure atomicity and data integrity (e.g., creating a conversation and its first message).
      * **Compensation Logic:** For distributed or asynchronous operations (e.g., data ingestion where multiple steps write to different databases), compensation logic or saga patterns will be considered to ensure eventual consistency in case of failures.
      * **Idempotency:** Critical operations (especially data ingestion, API calls that modify state) will be designed to be **idempotent** where possible, allowing them to be safely retried without unintended side effects.
