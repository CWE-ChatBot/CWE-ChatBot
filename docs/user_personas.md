## **User Scenarios**

Here are the scenarios describing how each persona would interact with the CWE ChatBot.

### **Drafting an Urgent Vulnerability Advisory**

**Persona:** Priya the Proactive PSIRT Member

**Narrative:**

* **Pre-Narrative (The World Today):** "An urgent, high-severity vulnerability report just landed in my inbox. I have to drop everything. I'm reading through developer notes and a proof-of-concept, trying to figure out the root cause. Now the 'fun' part: I open another browser tab to the CWE website. I start with a keyword search, click through a few entries, read long descriptions... is it 'Improper Neutralization of Special Elements' or something more specific? I'm wasting precious minutes and I'm always second-guessing myself before I put the final CWE in the advisory."  
* **Post-Narrative (The Aspirational Future):** "An urgent vulnerability report comes in. I copy the summary from the ticket and paste it directly into the CWE ChatBot. Instantly, it gives me a prioritized list of three potential CWEs, with the top one at 95% confidence. It even quotes the part of the bug report that justifies its reasoning. I ask it, 'Why not CWE-89?' and it explains the distinction. I'm confident in my choice and have the advisory drafted in under 10 minutes. This is a game-changer."

**Goal / Objective:** To quickly receive a prioritized and accurate CWE recommendation based on a bug report summary to accelerate vulnerability advisory creation. (Ref: USR\_PSIRT\_INPUT)

**Context / Situation:** A new, high-priority vulnerability has been reported and an external advisory needs to be written under a tight deadline.

**Steps / User Journey:**

1. Priya opens the CWE ChatBot.  
2. She selects her role as "PSIRT Member" to tailor the responses. (Ref: FR4)  
3. She pastes the technical summary from the bug report into the chat window. (Ref: FR7)  
4. The ChatBot returns a short, prioritized list of CWE suggestions with confidence scores. (Ref: FR15)  
5. She asks a follow-up question: "Explain the reasoning for the top choice." (Ref: FR16)  
6. The ChatBot provides an explanation, quoting from the CWE mapping notes.  
7. Satisfied, she copies the correct CWE ID for her advisory.

**Success Criteria:**

* A correct, defensible CWE is identified within minutes.  
* Priya feels confident in the mapping decision.  
* The time taken to draft the advisory is significantly reduced.

### **Mapping a Vulnerability During a Bug Fix**

**Persona:** David the Dedicated Developer

**Narrative:**

* **Pre-Narrative (The World Today):** "A ticket for a security vulnerability just got assigned to me. The scanner flagged it as CWE-79, but the description is vague. I think I know how to fix the bug, but I want to be sure I understand the *why*. I go to the CWE website, and the explanation is so generic. There are no code examples in Python, so I'm left to guess how the abstract concept applies to my code. It feels like a chore that gets in the way of me actually shipping the fix."  
* **Post-Narrative (The Aspirational Future):** "A security ticket comes in. I copy the vulnerable function from my IDE and paste it into the CWE ChatBot. It immediately identifies the correct CWE and, more importantly, gives me a detailed explanation of *why* it's a vulnerability, quoting directly from the official description and listing common consequences. I can ask, 'Show me examples related to this CWE,' and it pulls up the generic code snippets from the CWE's documentation. It gives me the expert context I need to write a solid fix myself, and I understand the pattern much better now."

**Goal / Objective:** To accurately identify the correct CWE for a piece of code and get actionable explanations to implement a proper fix without delay. (Ref: USR\_DEV\_SOURCE\_CODE)

**Context / Situation:** David is working on a ticket to fix a security vulnerability identified in the codebase during a sprint.

**Steps / User Journey:**

1. David opens the ChatBot.  
2. He pastes the vulnerable code snippet and a brief description of the issue. (Ref: FR8)  
3. The ChatBot identifies the most likely CWE. (Ref: FR12)  
4. David asks a follow-up question: "Give me a detailed explanation and any available code examples for this." (Ref: FR5)  
5. The ChatBot provides a detailed summary of the weakness, its consequences, and shows illustrative code examples if they exist within the CWE corpus data.  
6. David uses this expert context to implement the patch and updates the ticket with the correct CWE ID.

**Success Criteria:**

* The correct CWE is identified and logged.  
* David receives clear, context-specific explanations that help him write the fix.  
* The time spent on security research is minimized, allowing him to focus on coding.  
* David understands the underlying weakness better, helping him avoid it in the future.

### **Planning the Next Quarter's Security Initiatives**

**Persona:** Marcus the Strategic Product Manager

**Narrative:**

* **Pre-Narrative (The World Today):** "I'm heading into quarterly planning, and I have a gut feeling we should be focusing more on proactive security, but a 'gut feeling' doesn't justify a budget request. I have no easy way to get credible, industry-wide data to show what we *should* be worried about. I end up arguing for security work based on anecdotes, which makes it hard to convince stakeholders to invest in prevention over new features."  
* **Post-Narrative (The Aspirational Future):** "It's a week before our planning session. I open the CWE ChatBot and ask, 'What are the top 5 weaknesses in the latest CWE Top 25 list?' It gives me a clean summary instantly. I can drill down: 'Explain CWE-787 in simple terms and why it's a risk.' Using this credible, industry-standard data, I can build a powerful business case: 'These are the most dangerous issues in our industry right now; let's proactively invest in training and tools to ensure we're protected.' My proposal is no longer a guess; it's a strategic plan benchmarked against the entire industry."

**Goal / Objective:** To use public, industry-wide CWE data (like the Top 25\) as a proxy to create a credible, data-backed proposal for proactive security initiatives. (Ref: USR\_PM\_RESOURCE\_ALLOCATION)

**Context / Situation:** Marcus is preparing for a quarterly planning meeting and needs to build a data-driven case for proactive security investments, but lacks access to internal product-specific vulnerability trends.

**Steps / User Journey:**

1. Marcus opens the CWE ChatBot.  
2. He queries the bot: "Show me the latest CWE Top 25 list." (Ref: FR6)  
3. The ChatBot returns the official list of the most dangerous software weaknesses.  
4. Marcus asks a follow-up question: "Give me a simple explanation for the \#1 weakness on that list and its common consequences." (Ref: FR5)  
5. The ChatBot provides a summary tailored for a less technical audience.  
6. Marcus uses this information to build a presentation slide proposing a targeted training initiative, justifying it with the official industry-wide risk data.

**Success Criteria:**

* Marcus creates a compelling, data-backed proposal for a security initiative.  
* The proposal is grounded in credible, industry-standard data, not just anecdotes.  
* Stakeholders are more easily convinced to allocate resources to proactive security work.

### **Exploring Vulnerability Trends for a Research Paper**

**Persona:** Dr. Alistair Finch, The Insightful Researcher

**Narrative:**

* **Pre-Narrative (The World Today):** "I'm writing a paper on the prevalence of path traversal vulnerabilities. I have a huge dataset of CVEs, but the CWE mappings are inconsistent. To do this right, I have to open the CWE website and manually click through dozens of entries, tracing the 'ChildOf' relationships to group them correctly. It's a frustrating, error-prone process that feels more like data entry than research."  
* **Post-Narrative (The Aspirational Future):** "Now, I simply open the chatbot. I can ask my research question directly: 'List all CWEs that are descendants of CWE-22 and provide their names.' In seconds, I have a complete, structured list ready for analysis. I can even probe deeper: 'What is the conceptual difference between CWE-23 and CWE-36?' I can focus on generating insights, not just collecting data."

**Goal / Objective:** To efficiently explore CWE relationships and hierarchies with limited context to support academic research on vulnerability trends. (Ref: USR\_ACADEMIC\_ANALYSIS)

**Context / Situation:** Dr. Finch is analyzing a large dataset of public vulnerabilities for a research paper and needs to categorize them accurately and understand their relationships.

**Steps / User Journey:**

1. Alistair opens the CWE ChatBot.  
2. He poses a direct query about relationships: "Show me all direct children of CWE-22." (Ref: NFR25)  
3. The ChatBot returns a structured list of the child CWEs and their names.  
4. He asks a follow-up question: "Explain the difference between CWE-23 and CWE-36." (Ref: NFR29)  
5. The ChatBot provides a clear, comparative explanation.  
6. He exports the conversation to include in his research notes. (Ref: FR22)

**Success Criteria:**

* Alistair gathers data on CWE relationships in minutes instead of hours.  
* The chatbot helps clarify subtle distinctions between weaknesses, improving research accuracy.  
* His time is shifted from tedious data collection to valuable data analysis.

### **Submitting a High-Impact Vulnerability Report**

**Persona:** "Zero" the Elite Bug Hunter

**Narrative:**

* **Pre-Narrative (The World Today):** "I just found a great bugâ€”I can use a URL parameter to read local files off the server. Now I have to write the report. I go to the CWE site and search. Okay, I see CWE-22, but there are a dozen related ones. Is my finding a 'Relative Path Traversal' or something else? It's not clear from the outside. I'll just pick the main one, but I know it makes my report look less precise."  
* **Post-Narrative (The Aspirational Future):** "I just found a sweet path traversal. I open the CWE ChatBot and describe what I did: 'I sent a payload with "....//" to a file download API and was able to read `/etc/passwd`.' The bot immediately comes back: 'This behavior strongly matches CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal. It's distinct from CWE-23 because...' The explanation is perfect. I use that specific CWE in my report, which helps it get triaged faster and makes me look like a pro."

**Goal / Objective:** To map a vulnerability to an accurate and credible CWE based on exploit information to improve a bug bounty submission. (Ref: USR\_BUG\_BOUNTY\_MAPPING)

**Context / Situation:** "Zero" has discovered a new vulnerability and is preparing their report for a bug bounty program.

**Steps / User Journey:**

1. "Zero" opens the CWE ChatBot.  
2. They describe the exploit's behavior: "I was able to read a system file by manipulating the `filename` parameter in the download endpoint." (Ref: FR10)  
3. The ChatBot analyzes the description and suggests a short, prioritized list of CWEs with confidence scores. (Ref: FR15)  
4. "Zero" asks for more detail on the top suggestion to confirm its relevance. (Ref: FR16)  
5. The ChatBot provides the full CWE name, description, and reasoning.  
6. "Zero" confidently includes the precise CWE ID in their bug bounty report.

**Success Criteria:**

* A credible and specific CWE is identified based solely on the exploit's behavior.  
* The quality and professionalism of the bug bounty report are significantly enhanced.  
* The process of finding the correct CWE is reduced to seconds.
