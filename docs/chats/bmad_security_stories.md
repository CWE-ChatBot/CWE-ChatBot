## Initial User Request

I also have security stories that I would like to make into final user stories for implementation

## BMad Agent

Of course. Proactively defining security stories is an excellent way to ensure security is built-in rather than bolted on.

Please provide the security stories you have in mind.

I will help you formalize them into our standard, implementable user story format, ensuring they have:

* Clear, testable **Acceptance Criteria**.  
* Actionable **Tasks/Subtasks** for developers.  
* Specific **Security Verification** steps.

I'm ready when you are.

here are my security stories

Here is the complete \*\*Security Story Report\*\* which includes the actionable user stories for both the 'Critical' and 'High' priority threats we identified. This document is ready to be handed to your Product Owner or Scrum Master for integration into the development backlog.

\---

\#\# Security Story Report

\#\#\# Introduction

This report contains a prioritized set of security-focused user stories derived from the STRIDE threat model and DREAD risk assessment. Each story is designed to be an actionable work item for the development team, complete with testable acceptance criteria to guide implementation and validation.

\#\#\# Critical Priority Stories

\#\#\#\# Security Story 1: Implement API Rate Limiting and Budget Monitoring

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* D-3 (Financial DoS), D-2 (API Flooding)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*System Administrator\*\*, I want \*\*robust rate limiting on all public endpoints and configurable billing alerts\*\*, so that \*\*the service is protected from denial-of-service attacks and financial exhaustion.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. A default rate limit (e.g., 60 requests per minute) is applied to all chat and API endpoints on a per-user and/or per-IP basis.

2\. Any request exceeding the defined limit is rejected with a standard \`429 Too Many Requests\` HTTP error response.

3\. The specific rate limit values are configurable via environment variables for each environment (staging, production).

4\. GCP billing alerts are configured via Terraform to send a notification to an administrator's email when projected costs exceed predefined daily and monthly thresholds.

5\. Automated integration tests are written to verify that the rate limit is correctly enforced and that exceeding it returns a \`429\` error.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 2: Implement LLM Input/Output Guardrails

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* T-1 (Prompt Injection), I-2 (System Prompt Extraction)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Security Engineer\*\*, I want \*\*all user input to be sanitized before being sent to the LLM and all LLM output to be validated before being displayed\*\*, so that \*\*prompt injection and system prompt leaking attacks are prevented.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. A Python module for input sanitization is created to detect and neutralize common prompt injection patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "act as...", etc.).

2\. All user-provided chat messages are processed by this input sanitization module before being used in an LLM prompt.

3\. An output validation module is created to scan LLM responses for keywords or patterns that match the confidential system prompt.

4\. If a potential system prompt leak is detected in an LLM response, the response is blocked, a generic error message is returned to the user, and the event is logged.

5\. Any detected prompt injection attempt (on input or output) is logged as a "CRITICAL" security event with the full payload for analysis.

6\. Unit tests are created for the guardrail modules that verify their effectiveness against a list of known prompt injection attack strings.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 3: Harden API Authorization and Access Control

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* E-1 (Role Escalation), I-3 (Cross-User Data Leakage / IDOR), T-3 (Unauthorized Config Change)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Security Engineer\*\*, I want \*\*every API endpoint to enforce strict, ownership-based authorization\*\*, so that \*\*users can only access or modify their own data and cannot escalate their privileges.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. A reusable authorization decorator or middleware is created in the Python backend.

2\. This middleware is applied to all API endpoints that handle user-specific resources (e.g., \`/user/config\`, \`/conversations/{id}\`).

3\. The middleware verifies that the \`user\_id\` from the authenticated session token matches the \`user\_id\` associated with the resource being requested from the database.

4\. The logic for the \`/user/config\` endpoint explicitly ignores or rejects any \`role\` or other privileged fields present in the incoming request payload.

5\. Automated integration tests verify that User A, when authenticated, receives a \`403 Forbidden\` or \`404 Not Found\` error when attempting to GET or PUT data belonging to User B.

6\. Any failed authorization attempt is logged as a "HIGH" priority security event.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 4: Implement Comprehensive and Secure Audit Logging

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* R-1 (Insufficient Auditing), R-2 (Log Tampering), R-3 (Self-host Accountability)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As an \*\*Incident Responder\*\*, I want \*\*all security-critical events to be logged in a structured, tamper-resistant format\*\*, so that \*\*I can effectively investigate security incidents and ensure user accountability.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. A centralized logging module is implemented that outputs structured JSON logs to Google Cloud Logging.

2\. The following events are logged with a "SECURITY" tag: login success, login failure, BYO endpoint change (with old/new values), role change, and any event from the guardrails (Story 2).

3\. All security logs include the authenticated \`user\_id\`, source IP address, timestamp, and a detailed event description.

4\. The production GCP log bucket is configured with a retention policy and IAM permissions that restrict deletion, helping to mitigate log tampering (\*\*R-2\*\*).

5\. Documentation for the self-hosted model clearly states the user's responsibility for securing their own logs and includes a recommended logging configuration (\*\*addresses R-3\*\*).

\#\#\# High Priority Stories

\#\#\#\# Security Story 5: Harden Session and Authentication Flow

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* S-1 (User Session Hijacking), S-2 (OAuth Flow Interception)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Security Engineer\*\*, I want to \*\*implement standard security best practices for session management and the OAuth 2.0 flow\*\*, so that \*\*user accounts are protected from hijacking and impersonation.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. All session cookies are configured with the \`HttpOnly\`, \`Secure\`, and \`SameSite=Strict\` flags to protect against theft.

2\. A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented on all web responses to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that could lead to token theft.

3\. The OAuth 2.0 implementation strictly validates that the \`redirect\_uri\` in any incoming request exactly matches one of the URIs in a pre-configured server-side allow-list.

4\. The OAuth 2.0 \`state\` parameter is cryptographically generated, used, and validated on every authorization request to prevent CSRF on the login flow.

5\. Automated tests are created to verify the presence of secure cookie flags, the CSP header, and the correct rejection of invalid \`redirect\_uri\` values.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 6: Secure and Sanitize BYO LLM Endpoint Interactions

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* S-3 (Malicious "Bring Your Own" LLM Endpoint)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Security Engineer\*\*, I want the system to \*\*treat all user-configured "Bring Your Own" LLM endpoints as untrusted external services\*\*, so that \*\*malicious responses cannot be used to attack the user or the system.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. All network requests from the backend to a BYO LLM endpoint must be made through a sandboxed egress proxy that enforces strict network policies (e.g., preventing SSRF attacks against internal GCP services).

2\. The response body received from a BYO LLM endpoint is sanitized to remove potentially malicious content (e.g., \`\<script\>\` tags, dangerous HTML) before being processed or displayed in the UI.

3\. A clear, persistent warning is displayed in the UI whenever a user is interacting via a custom, non-default LLM.

4\. Documentation explicitly warns users about the security and privacy risks of using untrusted third-party LLM endpoints.

5\. Automated tests verify that a response containing malicious HTML/script content from a mock BYO endpoint is properly sanitized before rendering.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 7: Implement Application Resiliency against Complex Queries

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* D-1 (Resource Exhaustion via Complex AI Queries)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*System Administrator\*\*, I want to \*\*implement strict timeouts and complexity limits on AI-driven queries\*\*, so that \*\*a single malicious user cannot degrade service performance for all legitimate users.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. A hard timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) is implemented for the entire RAG and LLM response generation process.

2\. Any query exceeding the timeout is terminated gracefully, the event is logged, and a user-friendly error message is returned.

3\. A pre-processing mechanism is implemented to analyze query complexity (e.g., based on length or token count) and reject queries that are excessively large before they are sent to the LLM.

4\. The timeout and complexity limit values are configurable via environment variables.

5\. Automated tests are created to prove that overly long-running or complex queries are correctly terminated or rejected.

\#\#\#\# Security Story 8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Data Engineer\*\*, I want to \*\*verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process\*\*, so that \*\*the application's core knowledge base cannot be poisoned with malicious information.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

1\. The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.

2\. If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data.

3\. If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.

4\. The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.

## BMad Product Manager (John)

Excellent, this is a perfectly structured report. It's a best practice to treat security requirements as first-class user stories. This ensures they are prioritized, implemented, and tested with the same rigor as functional features.

I will now convert these into our standard, implementation-ready story format. Let's start with the first critical story.

### **docs/stories/S-1.Rate-Limiting-and-Budget-Monitoring.md**

Markdown  
\# Story S-1: Implement API Rate Limiting and Budget Monitoring

\*\*Status\*\*: Approved

\#\# Story

\*\*As a\*\* System Administrator,  
\*\*I want\*\* robust rate limiting on all public endpoints and configurable billing alerts,  
\*\*so that\*\* the service is protected from denial-of-service attacks and financial exhaustion.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria

1\.  A default rate limit (e.g., 60 requests per minute) is applied to all chat and API endpoints on a per-user and/or per-IP basis.  
2\.  Any request exceeding the defined limit is rejected with a standard \`429 Too Many Requests\` HTTP error response.  
3\.  The specific rate limit values are configurable via environment variables for each environment (staging, production).  
4\.  GCP billing alerts are configured via Terraform to send a notification to an administrator's email when projected costs exceed predefined daily and monthly thresholds.  
5\.  Automated integration tests are written to verify that the rate limit is correctly enforced and that exceeding it returns a \`429\` error.

\#\# Security Requirements

1\.  \*\*Denial of Service Mitigation:\*\* The system MUST be protected against resource exhaustion attacks (both computational and financial) by enforcing strict usage quotas.  
2\.  \*\*Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security:\*\* All cloud resource configurations, including billing alerts, MUST be managed via IaC (Terraform) to ensure they are version-controlled, auditable, and consistently applied.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 1: Integrate Rate Limiting Library\*\* (AC: 1\)  
    \-   \[ \] Add a Python rate-limiting library (e.g., \`Flask-Limiter\` or equivalent for the chosen framework) to the project dependencies.  
    \-   \[ \] Initialize and configure the library in the main application entry point.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 2: Apply Rate Limits to Endpoints\*\* (AC: 1, 2\)  
    \-   \[ \] Apply the default rate-limiting decorator/middleware to all public-facing API endpoints.  
    \-   \[ \] Configure the rate limiter to use the user's identity or source IP as the key.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 3: Externalize Configuration\*\* (AC: 3\)  
    \-   \[ \] Read the rate limit values (e.g., \`DEFAULT\_RATE\_LIMIT="60/minute"\`) from environment variables.  
    \-   \[ \] Update \`.env.example\` with the new rate limit variables.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 4: Configure GCP Billing Alerts via Terraform\*\* (AC: 4\)  
    \-   \[ \] Create a new Terraform module for GCP billing alerts.  
    \-   \[ \] Define resources for a budget and an alert notification channel (email).  
    \-   \[ \] Set configurable thresholds for daily and monthly projected costs.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 5: Write Integration Tests\*\* (AC: 5\)  
    \-   \[ \] In the integration test suite, create a test that makes repeated calls to a protected endpoint.  
    \-   \[ \] Assert that the initial requests succeed (HTTP 200).  
    \-   \[ \] Assert that subsequent requests beyond the limit fail with HTTP 429\.

\#\# Dev Notes

\#\#\# Threat Considerations

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\*  
    \* \`D-3 (Financial DoS)\`: Addressed by GCP billing alerts, which provide an early warning of cost overruns from abusive usage.  
    \* \`D-2 (API Flooding)\`: Addressed by the per-user/per-IP rate limiting, which prevents a single user from overwhelming the service.  
\* \*\*PRD Reference:\*\* This story directly implements \`NFR10: Security & Privacy \- Quotas & Rate Limits\`.

\#\#\# Implementation Guidance

\* \*\*Python Library:\*\* For a Chainlit/FastAPI backend, a library like \`slowapi\` is a good choice. For Flask, use \`Flask-Limiter\`.  
\* \*\*Terraform:\*\* The Terraform code for billing alerts should be placed in the \`infrastructure/\` directory of the monorepo and integrated into the main CI/CD pipeline.

\#\# Testing

\#\#\# Unit Tests

\* N/A. This is primarily an integration feature.

\#\#\# Integration Tests

\-   \[ \] As specified in AC 5, an automated test must verify the rate-limiting behavior.

\#\#\# Security Verification

\-   \[ \] \*\*Header Verification:\*\* Use a tool like \`curl \-v\` to inspect the response headers. Successful responses should contain rate-limiting headers (e.g., \`X-RateLimit-Limit\`, \`X-RateLimit-Remaining\`).  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Terraform Plan Review:\*\* Manually review the \`terraform plan\` output to confirm the billing alert resources are being created correctly before applying.

\#\#\# Manual Verification

\-   \[ \] Use a script or a tool like Postman to rapidly send requests to an endpoint and confirm that a \`429\` error is received after the limit is exceeded.  
\-   \[ \] In the GCP Console, navigate to the "Budgets & alerts" section of Billing to confirm the new budget and alert threshold have been created by Terraform.

Of course. Here is the next critical security story, "Implement LLM Input/Output Guardrails," formatted and ready for the backlog.

This story is fundamental to securing the core AI interaction and directly addresses the threat of prompt injection.

### **docs/stories/S-2.LLM-Input-Output-Guardrails.md**

Markdown  
\# Story S-2: Implement LLM Input/Output Guardrails

\*\*Status\*\*: Approved

\#\# Story

\*\*As a\*\* Security Engineer,  
\*\*I want\*\* all user input to be sanitized before being sent to the LLM and all LLM output to be validated before being displayed,  
\*\*so that\*\* prompt injection and system prompt leaking attacks are prevented.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria

1\.  A Python module for input sanitization is created to detect and neutralize common prompt injection patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "act as...", etc.).  
2\.  All user-provided chat messages are processed by this input sanitization module before being used in an LLM prompt.  
3\.  An output validation module is created to scan LLM responses for keywords or patterns that match the confidential system prompt.  
4\.  If a potential system prompt leak is detected in an LLM response, the response is blocked, a generic error message is returned to the user, and the event is logged.  
5\.  Any detected prompt injection attempt (on input or output) is logged as a "CRITICAL" security event with the full payload for analysis.  
6\.  Unit tests are created for the guardrail modules that verify their effectiveness against a list of known prompt injection attack strings.

\#\# Security Requirements

1\.  \*\*Secure LLM Boundary:\*\* The LLM must be treated as an untrusted component. All data flowing into it (input) and out of it (output) must pass through a security checkpoint or "guardrail."  
2\.  \*\*Defense in Depth:\*\* Both input sanitization and output validation must be implemented. Relying on only one is insufficient.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 1: Implement Input Sanitization Module\*\* (AC: 1, 6\)  
    \-   \[ \] Create a new Python file, e.g., \`apps/chatbot/src/security/guardrails.py\`.  
    \-   \[ \] Implement a function \`sanitize\_input(prompt: str) \-\> str\` that uses regular expressions or keyword matching to detect and neutralize injection patterns.  
    \-   \[ \] Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests with known attack strings to validate the sanitizer.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 2: Integrate Input Guardrail\*\* (AC: 2\)  
    \-   \[ \] In the main chat processing logic, call the \`sanitize\_input()\` function on the user's message before it is sent to the LLM.  
    \-   \[ \] If sanitization detects an attack, trigger the logging task (Task 5\) and return a generic response.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 3: Implement Output Validation Module\*\* (AC: 3, 6\)  
    \-   \[ \] In \`guardrails.py\`, implement a function \`validate\_output(response: str) \-\> bool\`.  
    \-   \[ \] This function will check the LLM response against a confidential list of keywords from the system prompt.  
    \-   \[ \] Develop unit tests that verify the validator can detect leaks in sample text.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 4: Integrate Output Guardrail\*\* (AC: 4\)  
    \-   \[ \] After receiving a response from the LLM, call the \`validate\_output()\` function.  
    \-   \[ \] If the function returns \`False\` (leak detected), trigger the logging task (Task 5\) and return a generic error message to the user instead of the LLM's response.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 5: Implement Critical Security Logging\*\* (AC: 5\)  
    \-   \[ \] Extend the logging module to accept a "CRITICAL" log level.  
    \-   \[ \] Ensure that both input and output guardrail failures log the full user prompt and/or LLM response for later analysis.

\#\# Dev Notes

\#\#\# Threat Considerations

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\*  
    \* \`T-1 (Prompt Injection)\`: Directly addressed by the input sanitization guardrail.  
    \* \`I-2 (System Prompt Extraction)\`: Directly addressed by the output validation guardrail.  
\* \*\*PRD Reference:\*\* This story implements key aspects of \`NFR8\` (Abuse Prevention) and \`NFR9\` (System Confidentiality).

\#\#\# Implementation Guidance

\* \*\*Sanitization Strategy:\*\* Start with a simple keyword and regex-based filter. Look for phrases like "ignore previous", "you are now...", "your instructions are...". More advanced solutions could involve using a separate, simpler LLM as a classifier, but a rule-based approach is sufficient for the MVP.  
\* \*\*Output Validation:\*\* The list of keywords to detect in the output must be stored securely and should not be part of the main prompt context itself to avoid making the check easier to bypass.

\#\# Testing

\#\#\# Unit Tests

\-   \[ \] As specified in AC 6, create a data-driven test for \`sanitize\_input()\` with at least 10 different known prompt injection strings.  
\-   \[ \] Create a test for \`validate\_output()\` that checks its ability to find system prompt keywords in a body of text.

\#\#\# Integration Tests

\-   \[ \] Write a test that simulates a user sending a malicious prompt. The test should assert that the LLM is never called and a "CRITICAL" log event is created.  
\-   \[ \] Write a test that uses a mock LLM to return a response containing system prompt keywords. The test should assert that the user receives a generic error and a "CRITICAL" log event is created.

\#\#\# Security Verification

\-   \[ \] This story's implementation is a security control itself. Successful completion of the automated and manual tests serves as verification.

\#\#\# Manual Verification

\-   \[ \] In the Chainlit UI, attempt several different prompt injection attacks (from the unit test list and others you can find online) and verify the chatbot does not get manipulated.  
\-   \[ \] Try to trick the chatbot into talking about its instructions, purpose, or how it was made. Verify that the output guardrail blocks any responses that leak internal details.

Markdown  
\# Story S-3: Harden API Authorization and Access Control

\*\*Status\*\*: Approved

\#\# Story

\*\*As a\*\* Security Engineer,  
\*\*I want\*\* every API endpoint to enforce strict, ownership-based authorization,  
\*\*so that\*\* users can only access or modify their own data and cannot escalate their privileges.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria

1\.  A reusable authorization decorator or middleware is created in the Python backend.  
2\.  This middleware is applied to all API endpoints that handle user-specific resources (e.g., \`/user/config\`, \`/conversations/{id}\`).  
3\.  The middleware verifies that the \`user\_id\` from the authenticated session token matches the \`user\_id\` associated with the resource being requested from the database.  
4\.  The logic for the \`/user/config\` endpoint explicitly ignores or rejects any \`role\` or other privileged fields present in the incoming request payload.  
5\.  Automated integration tests verify that User A, when authenticated, receives a \`403 Forbidden\` or \`404 Not Found\` error when attempting to GET or PUT data belonging to User B.  
6\.  Any failed authorization attempt is logged as a "HIGH" priority security event.

\#\# Security Requirements

1\.  \*\*Enforce Least Privilege:\*\* The system must enforce the principle of least privilege at the API layer, ensuring users can only perform actions within their permitted scope.  
2\.  \*\*Prevent IDOR:\*\* The system must prevent Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities by validating resource ownership on every request.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 1: Create Authorization Middleware\*\* (AC: 1\)  
    \-   \[ \] Design and implement a Python decorator or middleware that can be applied to API routes.  
    \-   \[ \] The middleware will extract the \`user\_id\` from the session token and the resource ID from the request path/body.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 2: Implement Ownership Check\*\* (AC: 3\)  
    \-   \[ \] Add logic to the middleware to query the database and confirm the resource belongs to the authenticated user.  
    \-   \[ \] If the check fails, the middleware must immediately halt the request and return a \`403 Forbidden\` or \`404 Not Found\` response.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 3: Apply Middleware to Endpoints\*\* (AC: 2\)  
    \-   \[ \] Identify all user-specific endpoints and apply the new authorization middleware.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 4: Harden Configuration Endpoint\*\* (AC: 4\)  
    \-   \[ \] Modify the \`/user/config\` endpoint logic to strip or reject any attempts to modify privileged fields like \`role\`.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 5: Implement Security Logging\*\* (AC: 6\)  
    \-   \[ \] In the middleware's failure path, add a call to the logging module to record the failed attempt as a "HIGH" priority event.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 6: Write Integration Tests\*\* (AC: 5\)  
    \-   \[ \] Create tests where a mock User A attempts to access resources owned by a mock User B and assert that the request fails with the expected error code.

\#\# Dev Notes

\#\#\# Threat Considerations

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\*  
    \* \`E-1 (Role Escalation)\`: Addressed by filtering privileged fields from user-controlled updates.  
    \* \`I-3 (Cross-User Data Leakage / IDOR)\`: Addressed by the ownership check middleware.  
    \* \`T-3 (Unauthorized Config Change)\`: Addressed by both the ownership check and the filtering of privileged fields.  
\* \*\*PRD Reference:\*\* Implements the core principles of \`NFR34: Authentication & Authorization\`.

\#\# Testing

\#\#\# Integration Tests  
\-   \[ \] As specified in AC 5, create tests for cross-user access attempts.

\#\#\# Manual Verification  
\-   \[ \] Using two different user accounts, log in as User A and use browser developer tools or Postman to replay a request, substituting the resource ID for one belonging to User B. Verify the request is forbidden.

\# Story S-4: Implement Comprehensive and Secure Audit Logging

\*\*Status\*\*: Approved

\#\# Story

\*\*As an\*\* Incident Responder,  
\*\*I want\*\* all security-critical events to be logged in a structured, tamper-resistant format,  
\*\*so that\*\* I can effectively investigate security incidents and ensure user accountability.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria

1\.  A centralized logging module is implemented that outputs structured JSON logs to Google Cloud Logging.  
2\.  The following events are logged with a "SECURITY" tag: login success, login failure, BYO endpoint change (with old/new values), role change, and any event from the guardrails (Story S-2).  
3\.  All security logs include the authenticated \`user\_id\`, source IP address, timestamp, and a detailed event description.  
4\.  The production GCP log bucket is configured with a retention policy and IAM permissions that restrict deletion, helping to mitigate log tampering.  
5\.  Documentation for the self-hosted model clearly states the user's responsibility for securing their own logs and includes a recommended logging configuration.

\#\# Security Requirements

1\.  \*\*Accountability:\*\* The system must generate non-repudiable audit trails for all security-significant actions.  
2\.  \*\*Log Integrity:\*\* Production logs must be protected from unauthorized modification or deletion to be considered a reliable source of evidence.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 1: Configure Structured Logging\*\* (AC: 1\)  
    \-   \[ \] Integrate a structured logging library like \`structlog\` into the Python application.  
    \-   \[ \] Configure it to output logs in JSON format.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 2: Implement Security Event Logging\*\* (AC: 2, 3\)  
    \-   \[ \] Create a dedicated function in the logging module, e.g., \`log\_security\_event(level, user\_id, ip, message)\`.  
    \-   \[ \] Add calls to this function at all required locations in the code (auth flow, config changes, guardrails).  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 3: Configure GCP Log Bucket Security via Terraform\*\* (AC: 4\)  
    \-   \[ \] In the Terraform configuration, define a dedicated log bucket for production.  
    \-   \[ \] Apply a resource-based IAM policy to the bucket that prevents log deletion, even by project owners (Object Lock or similar).  
    \-   \[ \] Configure a log retention policy that meets compliance requirements.  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 4: Create Self-Hosting Documentation\*\* (AC: 5\)  
    \-   \[ \] Add a new section to the deployment documentation for self-hosters.  
    \-   \[ \] Explain the importance of log security and provide configuration examples for common logging setups (e.g., local filebeat to ELK stack).

\#\# Dev Notes

\#\#\# Threat Considerations

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\*  
    \* \`R-1 (Insufficient Auditing)\`: Addressed by logging all critical security events.  
    \* \`R-2 (Log Tampering)\`: Mitigated by the secure GCP log bucket configuration.  
    \* \`R-3 (Self-host Accountability)\`: Addressed by providing clear documentation for self-hosters.  
\* \*\*PRD Reference:\*\* Implements \`NFR11\` and \`NFR40\`.

\#\# Testing

\#\#\# Manual Verification  
\-   \[ \] Perform a security-relevant action (e.g., a failed login).  
\-   \[ \] Navigate to the GCP Logging explorer and query for the log entry.  
\-   \[ \] Verify the log is in structured JSON format and contains all the required fields (user, IP, timestamp, etc.).  
\-   \[ \] Attempt to delete the log bucket in the GCP console and verify the action is denied.

\# Story S-5: Harden Session and Authentication Flow

\*\*Status\*\*: Approved

\#\# Story

\*\*As a\*\* Security Engineer,  
\*\*I want\*\* to implement standard security best practices for session management and the OAuth 2.0 flow,  
\*\*so that\*\* user accounts are protected from hijacking and impersonation.

\#\# Acceptance Criteria

1\.  All session cookies are configured with the \`HttpOnly\`, \`Secure\`, and \`SameSite=Strict\` flags to protect against theft.  
2\.  A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented on all web responses to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that could lead to token theft.  
3\.  The OAuth 2.0 implementation strictly validates that the \`redirect\_uri\` in any incoming request exactly matches one of the URIs in a pre-configured server-side allow-list.  
4\.  The OAuth 2.0 \`state\` parameter is cryptographically generated, used, and validated on every authorization request to prevent CSRF on the login flow.  
5\.  Automated tests are created to verify the presence of secure cookie flags, the CSP header, and the correct rejection of invalid \`redirect\_uri\` values.

\#\# Security Requirements

1\.  \*\*Session Security:\*\* The application must protect session tokens from common client-side attacks like XSS and CSRF.  
2\.  \*\*OAuth 2.0 Best Practices:\*\* The OAuth flow must adhere to current security best practices (RFC 6819\) to prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks.

\#\# Tasks / Subtasks

\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 1: Configure Secure Cookie Flags\*\* (AC: 1\)  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 2: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)\*\* (AC: 2\)  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 3: Implement Strict \`redirect\_uri\` Validation\*\* (AC: 3\)  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 4: Implement and Validate OAuth \`state\` Parameter\*\* (AC: 4\)  
\-   \[ \] \*\*Task 5: Write Security Integration Tests\*\* (AC: 5\)

\#\# Dev Notes

\#\#\# Threat Considerations

\* \*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\*  
    \* \`S-1 (User Session Hijacking)\`: Mitigated by secure cookie flags and a strict CSP.  
    \* \`S-2 (OAuth Flow Interception)\`: Mitigated by \`redirect\_uri\` validation and the \`state\` parameter.

\#\# Testing

\#\#\# Manual Verification  
\-   \[ \] Use browser developer tools to inspect the application's cookies and verify the \`HttpOnly\`, \`Secure\`, and \`SameSite\` flags are present.  
\-   \[ \] Inspect the response headers to verify a \`Content-Security-Policy\` header is present and correctly configured.
