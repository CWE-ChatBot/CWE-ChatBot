Of course. This is an excellent and timely request. The new **OWASP GenAI Security Top 10 for LLM and Generative AI guide** provides a critical framework for securing agentic applications. I will review all our existing security documents and update them to incorporate this state-of-the-art guidance.

My review of the guide highlights several key concepts we must integrate:

* **Key Components (KCs):** The guide defines a clear vocabulary for agentic architectures (LLMs, Orchestration, Memory, Tools, etc.) which we will adopt.  
* **Agentic Threats (T-Codes):** The guide introduces a new threat model (T1-T15) specifically for agentic systems, covering risks like Memory Poisoning (T1) , Tool Misuse (T2) , and Intent Breaking (T6). I will map our existing STRIDE threats to this new, more specific model.  
* **Secure Development Lifecycle:** The guide provides actionable recommendations for the entire lifecycle, including secure design, build, and runtime phases, which I will incorporate into our stories and checklists.

Here are the specific updates for each document based on the new OWASP guidance.

### **File: `architecture.md` (Updated)**

I've updated the architecture to explicitly adopt the OWASP terminology, classifying our system as a **Hierarchical Agent Architecture** and detailing the key components (KCs). I've also added a new section on **Runtime Hardening** as recommended by the guide.

### **Runtime Hardening**

(New Section based on OWASP Guide Section 9 )

To protect the production environment, the following runtime hardening principles will be applied:

* **Harden the Virtual Machine (Base Level):** The Cloud Run environment will be based on minimal, hardened base images. All unnecessary services and packages will be removed. Network access will be restricted by default.  
* **Contain the Agentic Runtime:** The Chainlit application will be containerized. Where it executes tools (like code interpreters in the future), it will do so in a sandboxed environment to restrict syscalls and filesystem access.  
* **Secure the Agent's Memory, Tools, and Context:** In-memory state will be encrypted where feasible and auto-cleared at session end. All tool calls will be validated at runtime.  
* **Observability \+ Forensics:** Every agent action (tool use, memory writes) will be logged with a timestamp, agent/user ID, and session ID for full traceability.  
* **Identity, Authentication, and Agent Authorization:** Each agent service will have a distinct, manageable machine identity (GCP Service Account) with least-privilege IAM roles.

### **File: `threat_model.md` (Updated)**

I have updated the threat model to incorporate the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) T-codes. This provides a more specific, industry-standard view of the risks. I've also added an Attack Surface Analysis based on the Key Components (KCs) of our architecture.

\#\#\# Data Integrity Test Cases

\#\#\#\# T-1: RAG Memory Poisoning

Feature: CWE Corpus Data Integrity

  To prevent the poisoning of the application's knowledge base,

  As the System,

  I must validate the integrity of the source CWE data before ingestion.

  Scenario: Rejecting a tampered CWE data file

    Given the data ingestion pipeline expects a file with a specific SHA-256 checksum

    When the pipeline downloads a CWE data file whose checksum does not match the expected value

    Then the ingestion process must immediately abort

    And no data from the tampered file must be written to the Vector Database

    And a "CRITICAL" security event for "Data integrity validation failed" must be logged

Yes, the user stories should be updated. While they are already strong, the OWASP guide provides more specific and actionable language that can make them even better. The core substance of the stories is correct, but we can enhance them by incorporating the guide's explicit recommendations for agentic systems.

I will update the two most relevant stories, S-2 (Guardrails) and S-8 (Data Integrity), to reflect this best practice.

File: /S-2.LLM-Input-Output-Guardrails.md (Updated)
This story is updated to include more specific OWASP-recommended techniques like using clear delimiters and schema enforcement.

# Story S-2: Implement LLM Input/Output Guardrails

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** Security Engineer,
**I want** all user input to be sanitized before being sent to the LLM and all LLM output to be validated before being displayed,
**so that** prompt injection and system prompt leaking attacks are prevented.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  [cite_start]A Python module for input sanitization is created to detect and neutralize common prompt injection patterns and **escape or strip special delimiters** (`##`, `<<`, `{{}}`) before they are inserted into a prompt[cite: 652].
2.  [cite_start]All user-provided chat messages are processed by this input sanitization module before being used in an LLM prompt[cite: 589].
3.  An output validation module is created to scan LLM responses for keywords or patterns that match the confidential system prompt.
4.  [cite_start]If a potential system prompt leak is detected in an LLM response, the response is blocked, a generic error message is returned to the user, and the event is logged[cite: 616].
5.  Any detected prompt injection attempt (on input or output) is logged as a "CRITICAL" security event with the full payload for analysis.
6.  Unit tests are created for the guardrail modules that verify their effectiveness against a list of known prompt injection attack strings.
7.  [cite_start]**New:** The system uses a structured format (like JSON) for tool arguments to constrain LLM output and reduce the risk of hallucinating new instructions[cite: 660].

## Security Requirements

1.  **Secure LLM Boundary:** The LLM must be treated as an untrusted component. [cite_start]All data flowing into it (input) and out of it (output) must pass through a security checkpoint or "guardrail." [cite: 646]
2.  **Defense in Depth:** Both input sanitization and output validation must be implemented. Relying on only one is insufficient.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Task 1: Implement Input Sanitization Module** (AC: 1, 6)
    -   [ ] Create `apps/chatbot/src/security/guardrails.py`.
    -   [ ] Implement a function `sanitize_input(prompt: str) -> str` that uses regular expressions or keyword matching to detect and neutralize injection patterns.
    -   [cite_start][ ] **Update:** Explicitly add logic to escape or remove special characters and delimiters that could be misinterpreted by the LLM[cite: 652].
    -   [ ] Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests with known attack strings to validate the sanitizer.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Implement Structured Output for Tools** (AC: 7)
    -   [cite_start][ ] Define strict Pydantic or JSON schemas for any internal tools the LLM may call in the future[cite: 659].
    -   [ ] Update the prompt templating to require the LLM to respond with JSON that conforms to these schemas, rather than natural language commands.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Output Validation Module** (AC: 3, 6)
    -   [ ] In `guardrails.py`, implement `validate_output(response: str) -> bool` to check the LLM response against a confidential list of system prompt keywords.
-   [ ] **Task 4: Integrate Guardrails into Chat Flow** (AC: 2, 4)
    -   [ ] In the main chat processing logic, integrate the `sanitize_input()` and `validate_output()` functions at the appropriate points.
    -   [ ] Ensure failures in either guardrail block the response and trigger logging.
-   [ ] **Task 5: Implement Critical Security Logging** (AC: 5)
    -   [ ] Extend the logging module to handle "CRITICAL" log level events from the guardrails.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * `T6 (Intent Breaking)` / `T-1 (Prompt Injection)`: Addressed by the input sanitization guardrail.
    * `I-2 (System Prompt Extraction)`: Addressed by the output validation guardrail.
* **PRD Reference:** Implements `NFR8` (Abuse Prevention) and `NFR9` (System Confidentiality).

### Implementation Guidance

* [cite_start]**Prompt Hardening:** Use clear delimiters (like XML tags) to separate system instructions from user input within the prompt itself[cite: 589]. This makes it harder for the LLM to confuse the two.
* [cite_start]**Output Validation:** The list of keywords to detect in the output must be stored securely and not be part of the main prompt context itself[cite: 663].

# Story S-8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** Data Engineer,
**I want** to verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process,
**so that** the application's core knowledge base (RAG Memory) cannot be poisoned with malicious information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.
2.  [cite_start]If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data[cite: 1392].
3.  If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.
4.  The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.
5.  [cite_start]**New:** All retrieved CWE data is validated against an expected schema before being processed for embedding to prevent storing corrupted or malformed data in the vector database[cite: 637].

## Security Requirements
1.  **Prevent Memory Poisoning:** The RAG knowledge base is a form of long-term memory. [cite_start]The system must have controls to prevent an attacker from corrupting this memory with false or malicious information[cite: 193].
2.  **Secure Supply Chain:** The data pipeline for the CWE corpus is a critical part of our software supply chain and must be secured against tampering.

## Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] **Task 1: Secure Data Download** (AC: 1)
-   [ ] **Task 2: Implement Integrity Validation** (AC: 2, 3)
-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Schema Validation** (AC: 5)
    -   [ ] Define a schema (e.g., Pydantic model) that represents a valid CWE entry.
    -   [ ] After parsing the downloaded file, validate each entry against this schema before it is sent for embedding.
-   [ ] **Task 4: Isolate the Ingestion Service** (AC: 4)
    -   [ ] Review the IAM roles and network policies for the data ingestion service to ensure it has no unnecessary permissions.

## Dev Notes

### Threat Considerations

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **`T1 (Memory Poisoning)`**: This is the primary threat mitigated by this story. [cite_start]By validating the source data's integrity, we prevent the RAG's long-term memory from being corrupted[cite: 193].
    * `T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)`: The original threat name, which is a specific form of Memory Poisoning.

## Testing
### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create a test that attempts to run the ingestion pipeline with a corrupted or schema-invalid data file and verify that the process aborts and logs a critical error.
