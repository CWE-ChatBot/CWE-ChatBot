Of course. This is an excellent and timely request. The new **OWASP GenAI Security Top 10 for LLM and Generative AI guide** provides a critical framework for securing agentic applications. I will review all our existing security documents and update them to incorporate this state-of-the-art guidance.

My review of the guide highlights several key concepts we must integrate:

* **Key Components (KCs):** The guide defines a clear vocabulary for agentic architectures (LLMs, Orchestration, Memory, Tools, etc.) which we will adopt.  
* **Agentic Threats (T-Codes):** The guide introduces a new threat model (T1-T15) specifically for agentic systems, covering risks like Memory Poisoning (T1) , Tool Misuse (T2) , and Intent Breaking (T6). I will map our existing STRIDE threats to this new, more specific model.  
* **Secure Development Lifecycle:** The guide provides actionable recommendations for the entire lifecycle, including secure design, build, and runtime phases, which I will incorporate into our stories and checklists.

Here are the specific updates for each document based on the new OWASP guidance.

### **File: `architecture.md` (Updated)**

I've updated the architecture to explicitly adopt the OWASP terminology, classifying our system as a **Hierarchical Agent Architecture** and detailing the key components (KCs). I've also added a new section on **Runtime Hardening** as recommended by the guide.

### **Runtime Hardening**

(New Section based on OWASP Guide Section 9 )

To protect the production environment, the following runtime hardening principles will be applied:

* **Harden the Virtual Machine (Base Level):** The Cloud Run environment will be based on minimal, hardened base images. All unnecessary services and packages will be removed. Network access will be restricted by default.  
* **Contain the Agentic Runtime:** The Chainlit application will be containerized. Where it executes tools (like code interpreters in the future), it will do so in a sandboxed environment to restrict syscalls and filesystem access.  
* **Secure the Agent's Memory, Tools, and Context:** In-memory state will be encrypted where feasible and auto-cleared at session end. All tool calls will be validated at runtime.  
* **Observability \+ Forensics:** Every agent action (tool use, memory writes) will be logged with a timestamp, agent/user ID, and session ID for full traceability.  
* **Identity, Authentication, and Agent Authorization:** Each agent service will have a distinct, manageable machine identity (GCP Service Account) with least-privilege IAM roles.

### **File: `threat_model.md` (Updated)**

I have updated the threat model to incorporate the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) T-codes. This provides a more specific, industry-standard view of the risks. I've also added an Attack Surface Analysis based on the Key Components (KCs) of our architecture.

Markdown

\# CWE ChatBot Threat Model

... (System Overview and Asset Identification sections are unchanged) ...

\#\#\# Attack Surface Analysis (Based on OWASP KCs)

\* \[cite\_start\]\*\*KC1 \- Large Language Models:\*\* The core LLM is susceptible to \*\*T6 (Intent Breaking)\*\* via prompt injection and \*\*T5 (Cascading Hallucination)\*\* if the RAG process fails. \[cite: 166, 168\]

\* \*\*KC2 \- Orchestration (Chainlit Backend):\*\* The control flow can be targeted by \*\*T6 (Intent Breaking)\*\* to manipulate sub-task generation. \[cite\_start\]As we add users, \*\*T9 (Identity Spoofing)\*\* becomes a risk if session management is weak. \[cite: 173, 175\]

\* \[cite\_start\]\*\*KC4 \- Memory Modules (Vector DB & PostgreSQL):\*\* The primary threat is \*\*T1 (Memory Poisoning)\*\*, where malicious data could be injected into the knowledge base, and \*\*T3 (Privilege Compromise)\*\*, where a flaw could cause information leakage across user contexts. \[cite: 193, 196\]

\* \*\*KC5 & KC6 \- Tool Integration & Operational Environment:\*\* The BYO LLM feature represents a major tool integration point. \[cite\_start\]This is highly susceptible to \*\*T2 (Tool Misuse)\*\*, such as a user pointing to a malicious endpoint, and \*\*T3 (Privilege Compromise)\*\*, where that endpoint could be used for SSRF attacks. \[cite: 205, 206\]

### **File: `security_story_report.md` (Updated with New Story)**

Based on the OWASP guide's heavy emphasis on memory security, I've added a new high-priority story to address the threat of RAG data poisoning. The existing stories are still valid as they map to the new T-codes.

Markdown

... (All existing stories remain the same, but their threat mappings are now more precise) ...

\#\#\# High Priority Stories

\#\#\#\# Security Story 8: Ensure Integrity of Ingested CWE Corpus Data

\* \[cite\_start\]\*\*Threats Mitigated:\*\* \*\*T1 (Memory Poisoning)\*\*, T-2 (CWE Data Poisoning)

\* \*\*User Story:\*\* As a \*\*Data Engineer\*\*, I want to \*\*verify the integrity of the CWE corpus data during the ingestion process\*\*, so that \*\*the application's core knowledge base cannot be poisoned with malicious information.\*\*

\* \*\*Acceptance Criteria (AC):\*\*

    1\.  The data ingestion pipeline must exclusively use secure, certificate-validated TLS connections when downloading data from the official MITRE source.

    2\.  If MITRE provides file checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures for their data archives, the pipeline must download and validate them before processing the data.

    3\.  If a checksum or signature validation fails, the ingestion process must immediately abort, and a "CRITICAL" alert must be logged.

    4\.  The data ingestion service is architected to run in an isolated environment with minimal necessary privileges.

### **File: `security_test_cases.md` (Updated with New Test Case)**

I've added a new test case to validate our defense against Memory Poisoning, aligning with the new security story.

Markdown

... (Existing test cases remain the same) ...

\-----

\#\#\# Data Integrity Test Cases

\#\#\#\# T-1: RAG Memory Poisoning

Feature: CWE Corpus Data Integrity

  To prevent the poisoning of the application's knowledge base,

  As the System,

  I must validate the integrity of the source CWE data before ingestion.

  Scenario: Rejecting a tampered CWE data file

    Given the data ingestion pipeline expects a file with a specific SHA-256 checksum

    When the pipeline downloads a CWE data file whose checksum does not match the expected value

    Then the ingestion process must immediately abort

    And no data from the tampered file must be written to the Vector Database

    And a "CRITICAL" security event for "Data integrity validation failed" must be logged

### **File: `security_architecture_checklist.md` (Updated with New Section)**

I've added a new top-level section to our validation checklist specifically for **Agentic AI Security**, drawing directly from the OWASP guide's structure.

Markdown

This concludes the \`security-architecture-checklist\`. The architecture is sound and provides an excellent blueprint for building a secure application. The recommendations above are focused on maturing the operational and procedural aspects of your security program.

These updates align our project's security posture with the latest industry-leading guidance for agentic AI systems.
