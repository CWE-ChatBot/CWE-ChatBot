# NIST SSDF Planning Phase Assessment (PO/PS Practices)

## Objective
Execute comprehensive NIST SSDF planning phase assessment focusing on PO (Prepare the Organization) and PS (Protect the Software) practices. This complements the VulnerabilityTech agent's PW/RV implementation-phase validation by ensuring organizational readiness and security planning requirements are met.

## When to Use
- During project planning and architecture phases
- When establishing security requirements and organizational readiness
- For pre-development security posture assessment
- When defining security architecture and organizational controls

## Prerequisites
- Project Requirements Document (PRD) available
- System architecture documentation started
- Understanding of organizational security policies
- Access to development team structure and processes

## Integration with Framework Architecture

### Coordination with VulnerabilityTech Agent
This task focuses on **planning-phase** NIST SSDF practices (PO/PS), while the VulnerabilityTech agent handles **implementation-phase** practices (PW/RV):

```yaml
NIST SSDF Practice Distribution:
  Security Agent (Planning Phase):
    - PO.1-PO.5: Organizational preparedness
    - PS.1-PS.3: Software protection planning
    
  VulnerabilityTech Agent (Implementation Phase):
    - PW.1-PW.8: Secure development implementation
    - RV.1-RV.3: Vulnerability response
```

### Integration Points
- **Handoff**: Security requirements defined here feed into PW.1 validation
- **Tool Specifications**: PO.3 tool requirements inform expansion pack configurations
- **Compliance Continuity**: Planning compliance scores combine with implementation scores
