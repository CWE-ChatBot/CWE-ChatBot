- Understanding of the codebase architecture and technology stack

## Process

### Phase 1: Produce Well-Secured Software (PW) Validation

2. Does the implementation match the security architecture specifications?
3. Are threat mitigations properly implemented?
4. Do access controls follow the principle of least privilege?

**Code Review Focus Areas:**
