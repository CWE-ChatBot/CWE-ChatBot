# dread-assessment

Performs enhanced quantitative risk assessment using the DREAD methodology, integrated with current threat intelligence and sophisticated risk analysis models to prioritize security threats with evidence-based numerical scoring.

**Enhanced DREAD Framework:**
- **Risk Analysis Models**: Uses `.bmad-core/utils/security-analysis.md` for quantitative risk assessment methodologies
- **Threat Intelligence**: Leverages `.bmad-core/data/threat-intelligence.md` for current attack feasibility and actor capabilities
- **Industry Context**: References `.bmad-core/data/security-methodologies.md` for DREAD best practices and sector-specific scoring

## Prerequisites

- Completed threat model with identified threats
- Understanding of system architecture and business impact
- Access to technical documentation and threat scenarios
- Current threat intelligence context for your industry/technology stack

## DREAD Assessment Process

DREAD is a quantitative risk assessment framework that scores threats on five criteria using a 1-10 scale:

### Enhanced DREAD Scoring Criteria

Before scoring, establish **threat actor context** using `.bmad-core/data/threat-intelligence.md`:
- **Relevant threat actors** for your industry (APTs, cybercriminals, insiders, hacktivists)
- **Current attack campaigns** targeting your technology stack
- **Known exploits** for your system components

**Damage Potential (1-10):**
How much damage could this threat cause if successfully exploited?

*Enhanced Scoring Guidance:*
- **1-3: Minimal damage** - Limited functionality impact, no sensitive data exposure, minimal business disruption
- **4-6: Moderate damage** - Service degradation, some confidential data exposure, short-term business impact
- **7-8: Major damage** - Significant service disruption, substantial data breach, major business/reputation impact
- **9-10: Catastrophic damage** - Complete system compromise, massive data breach, existential business threat

*Damage Assessment Framework* (Reference: `.bmad-core/utils/security-analysis.md`):
- **Confidentiality Impact**: None/Partial/Complete data exposure
- **Integrity Impact**: None/Partial/Complete data modification capabilities  
- **Availability Impact**: None/Partial/Complete service disruption
- **Business Impact**: Operational, financial, regulatory, reputational consequences

**Reproducibility (1-10):**
How easy is it for an attacker to reproduce this exploit?

*Enhanced Scoring with Threat Intelligence:*
- **1-3: Very difficult** - Requires nation-state capabilities, zero-day exploits, insider access
- **4-6: Moderate difficulty** - Requires skilled cybercriminal capabilities, some specialized tools/knowledge
- **7-8: Easy to reproduce** - Script kiddie level, publicly available exploits, common attack tools
- **9-10: Always reproducible** - Automated exploits, widely available tools, minimal skill required

*Reproducibility Factors* (Reference current threat intelligence):
- **Exploit availability**: Are exploits publicly available or being used in active campaigns?
- **Tool accessibility**: Are attack tools readily available to threat actors?
- **Technical barriers**: What level of expertise is required for successful exploitation?

**Exploitability (1-10):**
- How much effort and skill is required to exploit this threat?
- 1-3: Very difficult (expert knowledge, custom tools, significant time)
- 4-6: Moderate difficulty (intermediate skills, some tools, moderate time)
- 7-8: Easy to exploit (basic skills, available tools, little time)
- 9-10: Trivial to exploit (no special skills, automated tools)

**Affected Users (1-10):**
- How many users or systems are affected by successful exploitation?
- 1-3: Very few users (single user, isolated system)
- 4-6: Some users (small group, single department)
- 7-8: Many users (large group, multiple departments)
- 9-10: All users (entire user base, all systems)

**Discoverability (1-10):**
- How easy is it for an attacker to discover this vulnerability?
- 1-3: Very hard to discover (hidden, requires insider knowledge)
- 4-6: Moderate to discover (requires investigation, some knowledge)
- 7-8: Easy to discover (visible, documented, well-known)
- 9-10: Obvious to discover (publicly visible, widely known)

### Enhanced Risk Score Calculation

**Primary DREAD Score = (Damage + Reproducibility + Exploitability + Affected Users + Discoverability) / 5**

**Advanced Risk Analysis** (Reference: `.bmad-core/utils/security-analysis.md`):

**Risk Adjustment Factors:**
- **Threat Actor Capability Multiplier**: 
  - Nation-state (1.2×), Organized cybercrime (1.1×), Insider threat (1.15×), Opportunistic (1.0×)
- **Industry Risk Factor**: 
  - Critical infrastructure (1.2×), Financial (1.15×), Healthcare (1.1×), Technology (1.05×), General (1.0×)
- **Current Campaign Activity**: 
  - Active targeting (+1.0), Recent campaign activity (+0.5), Historical activity (0.0)

**Final Risk Score = Primary DREAD Score × Capability Multiplier × Industry Factor + Campaign Activity**

### Enhanced Risk Score Interpretation

**Quantitative Risk Matrix:**
- **9.0-12.0**: **CRITICAL** - Emergency response required, executive notification
- **7.0-8.9**: **HIGH** - Immediate priority, deploy resources within 48-72 hours  
- **5.0-6.9**: **MEDIUM** - Planned remediation, address within current sprint/quarter
- **3.0-4.9**: **LOW** - Long-term planning, address as resources permit
- **1.0-2.9**: **NEGLIGIBLE** - Monitor, accept risk, or implement low-cost controls

**Business Risk Translation:**
- **Critical/High**: Board-level risk, potential regulatory action, major business impact
- **Medium**: Department-level risk, moderate business impact, compliance concerns  
- **Low/Negligible**: Operational risk, minimal business impact, best practice implementation

## Assessment Process

1. **Threat Inventory**
   - List all identified threats from threat modeling
   - Group related threats if appropriate
   - Ensure threats are specific and actionable

2. **Scoring Session**
   - Involve security experts, architects, and business stakeholders
   - Score each threat on all five DREAD criteria
   - Document rationale for each score
   - Reach consensus on scoring disputes

3. **Risk Calculation**
   - Calculate risk score for each threat
   - Rank threats by risk score
   - Group by risk levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

```

## Assessment Best Practices

### Scoring Guidelines

1. **Be Realistic**: Score based on realistic attack scenarios, not theoretical maximums
2. **Consider Context**: Factor in business impact, user base, and system criticality
3. **Document Rationale**: Record reasoning for each score to enable future reviews
4. **Seek Consensus**: Involve multiple stakeholders to reduce scoring bias
5. **Regular Reviews**: Update assessments as threats and systems evolve

### Common Scoring Pitfalls

- **Overscoring Damage**: Not all vulnerabilities lead to complete system compromise
- **Underestimating Discoverability**: Many vulnerabilities become well-known quickly
- **Ignoring Current Controls**: Factor in existing mitigations when scoring
- **Binary Thinking**: Use the full 1-10 scale, avoid clustering around 5s and 10s

### Integration with Risk Management

1. **Risk Register Integration**: Add DREAD scores to enterprise risk registers
2. **Resource Planning**: Use scores to prioritize security investment
3. **SLA Definition**: Define response time SLAs based on risk scores
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Use quantified scores for audit and compliance
