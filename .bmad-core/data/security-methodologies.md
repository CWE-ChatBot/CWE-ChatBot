# Security Methodologies Reference

This document provides comprehensive reference material for security methodologies, frameworks, and best practices used in defensive security analysis and implementation.

## Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE Framework
**Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege**

**Application:**
- Systematic threat identification across six categories
- Asset-based threat analysis
- Particularly effective for software applications and services

**Implementation Process:**
1. **System Decomposition** - Identify components, data flows, trust boundaries
2. **Threat Enumeration** - Apply STRIDE categories to each system element
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Evaluate system susceptibility to identified threats
4. **Risk Prioritization** - Rank threats by likelihood and impact
5. **Control Recommendation** - Define mitigations for high-priority threats

### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
**Seven-stage threat modeling methodology focused on risk and business impact**

**Seven Stages:**
1. **Define Objectives** - Business and security objectives alignment
2. **Define Technical Scope** - System boundaries and components
3. **Application Decomposition** - Detailed system analysis
4. **Threat Analysis** - Threat landscape and attack vectors
5. **Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis** - System vulnerabilities identification
6. **Attack Modeling** - Attack tree and scenario development
7. **Risk Impact Analysis** - Business risk assessment and prioritization

### LINDDUN Framework
**Privacy-focused threat modeling methodology**

**Categories:** Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-compliance

**Application:**
- Privacy-by-design implementation
- GDPR and privacy regulation compliance
- Data protection impact assessments

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### DREAD Methodology
**Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability**

**Scoring Scale:** 1-10 for each category
- **Damage Potential**: Impact severity if vulnerability exploited
- **Reproducibility**: Ease of reproducing the attack
- **Exploitability**: Skill/resources required for exploitation
- **Affected Users**: Percentage of user base impacted
- **Discoverability**: Likelihood of threat discovery

**Risk Calculation:** Total Score / 5 = Risk Rating
- **High Risk**: 7.0-10.0
- **Medium Risk**: 4.0-6.9
- **Low Risk**: 1.0-3.9

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
**Standardized vulnerability assessment framework**

**Base Metrics:**
- **Attack Vector**: Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical
- **Attack Complexity**: Low, High
- **Privileges Required**: None, Low, High
- **User Interaction**: None, Required
- **Scope**: Unchanged, Changed
- **Confidentiality Impact**: None, Low, High
- **Integrity Impact**: None, Low, High
- **Availability Impact**: None, Low, High

### FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
**Quantitative risk analysis methodology**

**Core Components:**
- **Risk**: Probability and magnitude of future loss
- **Loss Event Frequency**: Threat Event Frequency Ã— Vulnerability
- **Probable Loss Magnitude**: Primary + Secondary Loss magnitude

## Security Control Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
**Five Core Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**

**Implementation Tiers:**
1. **Partial** - Ad hoc, reactive approach
2. **Risk Informed** - Risk-informed policy and processes
3. **Repeatable** - Consistent, regular practices
4. **Adaptive** - Learning organization, continuous improvement

### ISO 27001/27002 Controls
