    title: DREAD Methodology and Scoring Criteria
    instruction: |
      Define the DREAD assessment methodology and scoring criteria used:
      
      **DREAD Components:**
      - **Damage (D)**: How bad would an attack be?
      - **Reproducibility (R)**: How easy is it to reproduce the attack?
      - **Exploitability (E)**: How much work is it to launch the attack?
      - **Affected Users (A)**: How many people would be impacted?
      - **Discoverability (D)**: How easy is it to discover the threat?
      
      **Scoring Scale (1-10):**
      - 1-3: Low risk/impact
      - 4-6: Medium risk/impact  
      - 7-8: High risk/impact
      - 9-10: Critical risk/impact
      
      Provide specific criteria for each score level for each DREAD component.

      - Threat name and brief description
      - Attack scenario summary
      - Affected system components
      - Current mitigation status

  - id: dread-scoring
    title: DREAD Scoring Analysis
    instruction: |
      Apply DREAD scoring to each identified threat. For each threat, provide:
      - Detailed rationale for each DREAD component score
      - Overall DREAD risk score (average or weighted average)
      - Risk level classification (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
      - Confidence level in the assessment
      
      Use the following format for each threat assessment:
      
      **Threat: [Threat Name]**
      - **Damage (D)**: [Score] - [Rationale]
      - **Reproducibility (R)**: [Score] - [Rationale]  
      - **Exploitability (E)**: [Score] - [Rationale]
      - **Affected Users (A)**: [Score] - [Rationale]
      - **Discoverability (D)**: [Score] - [Rationale]
      - **Overall DREAD Score**: [Score]
      - **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
      - **Assessment Confidence**: [Low/Medium/High]

    title: DREAD Scoring Matrix
    instruction: |
      Create a comprehensive scoring matrix showing all threats and their DREAD scores.
      This provides a quick reference and comparison view of all assessed threats.
    type: table
    columns:
      - Threat Name
      - Damage
      - Reproducibility  
      - Exploitability
      - Affected Users
      - Discoverability

  - id: risk-prioritization
    title: Risk Prioritization and Ranking
    instruction: |
      Prioritize threats based on DREAD scores and additional business context:
      - Rank threats from highest to lowest risk
      - Consider business impact and regulatory implications
      - Factor in current mitigation effectiveness
      - Account for implementation cost and effort
      - Provide recommended treatment approach for each risk level
      
      **Risk Treatment Approaches:**
      - **Critical (9-10)**: Immediate remediation required
      - **High (7-8)**: Remediate within current sprint/iteration
      - **Medium (4-6)**: Address in next planning cycle
      - **Low (1-3)**: Monitor and review periodically
