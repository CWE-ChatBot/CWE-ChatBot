# Security Analysis Utilities

This utility provides structured methodologies and analytical frameworks for comprehensive security analysis across different phases of the security lifecycle.

## Analysis Frameworks

### Security Risk Analysis Matrix

#### Risk Assessment Methodology
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact × Vulnerability × Threat Capability

Where:
- Likelihood: Probability of threat occurrence (1-5 scale)
- Impact: Business consequence of successful attack (1-5 scale)  
- Vulnerability: System susceptibility to exploitation (1-5 scale)
- Threat Capability: Adversary skill and resources (1-5 scale)
```

#### Risk Rating Scale
- **Critical (81-125)**: Immediate action required, business-critical risk
- **High (61-80)**: High priority, significant business impact
- **Medium (41-60)**: Moderate priority, manageable business impact
- **Low (21-40)**: Low priority, minimal business impact
- **Negligible (1-20)**: Acceptable risk, monitoring only

### Security Control Effectiveness Analysis

#### Control Assessment Framework
1. **Design Effectiveness**: Control adequately addresses identified risks
2. **Implementation Quality**: Control properly configured and deployed
3. **Operational Effectiveness**: Control functioning as intended in production
4. **Coverage Completeness**: Control addresses all relevant threat vectors
5. **Integration Quality**: Control works effectively with other security measures

#### Control Maturity Levels
- **Level 0 - Non-existent**: No security control implemented
- **Level 1 - Initial**: Ad-hoc, reactive security measures
- **Level 2 - Managed**: Documented procedures, basic monitoring
- **Level 3 - Defined**: Standardized processes, regular assessment
- **Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed**: Metrics-driven, continuous measurement
- **Level 5 - Optimizing**: Continuous improvement, proactive adaptation

```

### Security Architecture Analysis

#### Architecture Security Principles Validation
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers at different system levels
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access rights and permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state when security mechanisms fail
4. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify principle
5. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from initial design phases
6. **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple authorized individuals
7. **Complete Mediation**: Every access request is checked for authority
8. **Open Design**: Security mechanisms should not depend on secrecy

### Risk Calculation Models

#### Quantitative Risk Assessment
```
Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) = Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) × Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

Where:
SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
ARO = Frequency of threat occurrence per year

Return on Security Investment (ROSI) = (Risk Mitigation - Security Cost) / Security Cost × 100
```
