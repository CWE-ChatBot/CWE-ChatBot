# Security Deployment Validation Checklist

This checklist ensures security controls are properly configured and operational in production environments before system deployment and during ongoing operations.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Deployment configuration files and scripts
2. Production environment architecture documentation
3. Security implementation documentation
4. Network diagrams and firewall configurations
5. Monitoring and logging system configurations
6. Incident response procedures and contacts
7. Security testing results from pre-deployment validation

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:
1. Configuration Verification - Validate production security configurations
2. Operational Testing - Confirm security controls are functioning as designed
3. Monitoring Validation - Verify security monitoring and alerting systems
4. Compliance Verification - Ensure regulatory and policy compliance

EXECUTION MODE:
Choose deployment phase focus:
- Pre-Deployment - Configuration and readiness validation
- Go-Live - Operational security verification
- Post-Deployment - Ongoing security monitoring validation]]
