# Security Implementation Validation Checklist

This checklist ensures security controls are properly implemented according to architectural specifications and security best practices during development phases.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. Source code repositories and implementation artifacts
2. security-architecture.md or architecture.md with security specifications
3. Security requirements from PRD or security assessment
4. Configuration files and deployment scripts
5. Test results from security testing tools
6. Security control implementation documentation

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:
1. Code Review - Examine actual implementation against specifications
2. Configuration Validation - Verify security configurations are correctly applied
3. Testing Verification - Confirm security tests are implemented and passing
4. Documentation Review - Ensure implementation matches documented design

EXECUTION MODE:
Choose implementation phase focus:
- Development Phase - Code and configuration validation
- Testing Phase - Security test coverage and results
- Deployment Phase - Production security configuration validation]]
