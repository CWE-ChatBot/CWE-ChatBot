2. **Security Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze how the epic changes the application's attack surface
   - Identify new security boundaries and trust relationships
   - Evaluate impact on existing security controls
   - Assess changes to authentication and authorization requirements

3. **Feature-Specific Security Analysis**
   - Identify security-sensitive functionality within the epic
   - Analyze user input handling and data validation requirements
   - Review data storage and processing security implications
   - Evaluate third-party integration security considerations

4. **Threat Modeling for Epic**
   - Identify potential threats specific to the epic functionality
   - Analyze attack vectors that could exploit new features
   - Assess potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access
   - Evaluate data exposure risks

5. **Compliance Impact Review**
   - Determine if epic introduces new compliance requirements
   - Assess impact on existing compliance posture
   - Identify audit trail and documentation needs
   - Review data privacy and protection implications

## Epic Security Review Output

Add a "Security Review" section to the epic document:

```markdown

### Story-Level Security Guidance
**For Story Creation:**
- Each story implementing this epic should include security acceptance criteria
- Stories involving data handling must specify data validation requirements
- Stories with user interfaces must address XSS and CSRF protection
- Stories with API endpoints must include authentication/authorization validation

**Security Considerations for Dev Notes:**
- Input sanitization and validation patterns
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Logging requirements for security events
- Secure configuration requirements

### Compliance Impact
**Regulatory Considerations:**
- [List any new compliance requirements introduced]
- [Impact on existing compliance posture]
- [Required documentation or audit trail changes]

**Data Privacy Impact:**
- Personal data handling changes: [Description]
- Data retention implications: [Description]  
- User consent requirements: [Description]

### Implementation Security Guidelines
**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- [ ] Implement core authentication/authorization changes
- [ ] Set up security logging and monitoring
- [ ] Establish data validation frameworks

**Phase 2 (Feature Development):**
- [ ] Implement security controls for each story
- [ ] Add security tests for new functionality
- [ ] Conduct security code reviews

**Phase 3 (Validation):**
- [ ] Perform security testing of complete epic
- [ ] Validate compliance requirements
- [ ] Document security implementation

### Risk Assessment
**Overall Security Risk:** [Low / Medium / High]

**Risk Factors:**
- Data sensitivity: [Low / Medium / High]
- External interfaces: [None / Limited / Extensive]  
- Authentication complexity: [Simple / Moderate / Complex]
- Compliance impact: [None / Minor / Significant]

## Key Security Domains to Evaluate

### Authentication & Authorization
- New user roles or permissions required
- Changes to existing authentication flows
- Multi-factor authentication considerations
- Session management implications

### Data Security
- New data types being processed or stored
- Data classification and handling requirements
- Encryption requirements for sensitive data
- Data backup and recovery security implications

### API Security
- New API endpoints and their security requirements
- API authentication and rate limiting needs
- Input validation and sanitization requirements
- API documentation security considerations

### User Interface Security
- XSS protection requirements
- CSRF protection needs
- Content Security Policy implications
- User input handling and validation

### Integration Security

## Blocking Conditions

Stop review and escalate if:
- Epic involves processing highly sensitive data without adequate security design
- Significant compliance risks are identified
- Epic fundamentally conflicts with existing security architecture
- Critical security dependencies are missing or undefined
- Required security expertise is not available on the team

## Completion

After review:
1. Complete Security Review section in epic document
2. Flag any blocking security issues that must be resolved before story creation
3. Coordinate with PM and Architect on security requirement integration
4. Schedule security checkpoints during epic implementation
5. Identify if security specialist involvement is needed during development
