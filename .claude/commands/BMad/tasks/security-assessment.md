# Security Assessment Task

## Purpose

Conduct a comprehensive security assessment of the system, application, or infrastructure using enterprise-grade methodologies and current threat intelligence. This task provides a holistic evaluation that informs threat modeling, risk assessment, and mitigation planning activities.

**Enhanced Assessment Framework:**
- **Security Methodologies**: Leverages `.bmad-core/data/security-methodologies.md` for NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls frameworks
- **Threat Intelligence**: Uses `.bmad-core/data/threat-intelligence.md` for current threat landscape and attack vectors
- **Analysis Framework**: Applies `.bmad-core/utils/security-analysis.md` for risk assessment models and control evaluation
- **Compliance Integration**: References `.bmad-core/data/compliance-frameworks.md` for regulatory requirements

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Security Assessment
For new systems or applications requiring baseline security evaluation:
1. **System Analysis**: Evaluate architecture, design, and implementation
2. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities  
3. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current state against security best practices
4. **Recommendations**: Provide prioritized recommendations for improvement

### Scenario 2: Periodic Security Review
For existing systems requiring regular security evaluation:
1. **Change Assessment**: Evaluate security impact of recent changes
2. **Control Effectiveness**: Assess current security control effectiveness
3. **Emerging Threats**: Consider new threats and attack vectors
4. **Compliance Check**: Validate ongoing compliance with requirements

### Scenario 3: Pre-Deployment Assessment
For systems preparing for production deployment:
1. **Production Readiness**: Assess security readiness for production
2. **Risk Validation**: Validate that identified risks have been addressed
3. **Control Verification**: Verify security controls are properly implemented
4. **Sign-off Preparation**: Prepare security sign-off documentation

## Assessment Framework Selection

Before beginning the assessment, select the appropriate security framework based on your context (**Default: NIST Cybersecurity Framework for most organizations**). Reference `.bmad-core/data/security-methodologies.md`:

### **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** (Recommended for most organizations)
- **Best for**: Comprehensive cybersecurity program assessment
- **Focus**: Five core functions - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **Output**: Risk-based security posture assessment with prioritized improvements

### **ISO 27001/27002 Assessment** (For formal ISMS requirements)
- **Best for**: Organizations seeking ISO 27001 certification or formal ISMS
- **Focus**: 14 security control families across 114 detailed controls
- **Output**: Comprehensive control assessment with certification readiness

### **CIS Controls Assessment** (For practical, prioritized security)
- **Best for**: Organizations seeking practical, cost-effective security improvements
- **Focus**: 20 critical security controls prioritized by effectiveness
- **Output**: Prioritized control implementation roadmap

### **Industry-Specific Assessment** (For regulated industries)
- **Best for**: Organizations with specific compliance requirements
- **Focus**: Industry frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP, etc.)
- **Output**: Compliance-aligned security assessment with regulatory gap analysis
