- **Analysis Framework**: `.bmad-core/utils/security-analysis.md` for risk assessment models

**Step 1: Threat Actor Profiling**
Before applying STRIDE, establish relevant threat actor context for your system:

**Primary Threat Actors** (Select applicable from threat intelligence data - **Default: Include Cybercriminal Groups and Opportunistic Attackers for most systems**):
- [ ] **Nation-State APTs**: High sophistication, persistent, espionage/disruption motivated
- [x] **Cybercriminal Groups**: Financial motivation, ransomware, data theft, fraud *(Default - most common threat)*

- [ ] **Hacktivists**: Ideological motivation, public campaigns, DDoS/defacement
- [x] **Opportunistic Attackers**: Low sophistication, broad targeting, known exploits *(Default - baseline threat)*

**Step 2: Attack Vector Assessment**
Map current attack techniques to your system using MITRE ATT&CK framework:

**Initial Access Vectors** (Reference threat intelligence for current trends):
- Phishing and social engineering campaigns
- Exploitation of public-facing applications
- Supply chain compromise
- Valid account compromise
- External remote services exploitation

**Step 3: Systematic STRIDE Application**

Apply STRIDE methodology to each system component and data flow, considering identified threat actors and attack vectors. Document findings using the structured threat table format:

```

**Grammar Template Examples:**

```

3. **Mermaid Diagram Option**:

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before creating any Mermaid diagrams, review the complete Mermaid Syntax Guide at `.bmad-core/utils/mermaid-syntax-guide.md` to avoid common syntax errors that break diagram rendering.

**CRITICAL MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:**
- **NO double quotes (") in node labels** - These break diagram rendering
- **NO parentheses () in node labels** - Replace with dashes or remove  
- **NO special characters** in node labels - Use only letters, numbers, spaces, dashes
- **Always use square brackets []** for node labels with spaces
- **Example of CORRECT syntax:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    root[Compromise Application]
    auth[Gain Unauthorized Access]
    root --> auth
    auth1[Exploit Authentication Flow]
    auth --> auth1
    auth1a[JWT Token Manipulation]
    auth1 --> auth1a
    auth1b[OAuth Redirect Attack]
    auth1 --> auth1b
    data[Access Sensitive Data]
    root --> data
    data1[Database Compromise]
    data --> data1
    data1a[SQL Injection Attack]
    data1 --> data1a
```

**INVALID Examples to AVOID:**
```mermaid
// WRONG - Contains quotes and parentheses
root["Compromise Application (Critical)"]
auth["Gain "Admin" Access"]
attack["SQL Injection (OWASP #3)"]

// CORRECT - Clean labels
root[Compromise Application - Critical]
auth[Gain Admin Access]
attack[SQL Injection Attack - OWASP Top 3]
```

### Phase 6: Threat Scenario Development

**Realism Constraints and Plausibility Guidelines:**

Before developing detailed threat scenarios, apply these constraints to ensure practical, actionable threat analysis:

**Architectural Realism Requirements:**
- **Technology Stack Alignment**: Only include threats that are plausible given the described architecture, technologies, and trust boundaries
- **Access Vector Validation**: Ensure attack vectors are achievable within the system's actual exposure and access control model
- **Capability Boundaries**: Consider realistic attacker capabilities based on threat actor categories (internal, external, supply chain, physical)
- **Resource Proportionality**: Assess whether attack complexity is proportionate to likely attacker motivation and available resources

**Threat Actor Plausibility Assessment:**

Apply the **Intent-Capability-Opportunity (ICO) Framework** for each threat:

**Intent Assessment:**
- Does the threat actor have realistic motivation to target this specific system or organization?
- Is the potential gain (financial, competitive, ideological) proportionate to attack effort?
- Are there simpler, more attractive targets available to the attacker?

**Capability Assessment:**
- Does the threat actor possess the technical skills required for the attack?
- Are the necessary tools, resources, and knowledge accessible to this actor type?
- Is the attack complexity within reasonable bounds for the actor's skill level?

**Opportunity Assessment:**
- Does the threat actor have realistic access to the required attack surfaces?
- Are the necessary prerequisites and conditions achievable within the system context?
- Do existing security controls present realistic barriers or complete prevention?

**Plausibility Guidelines:**

**Include These Threat Types:**
- ✅ **Common Attack Patterns**: Well-documented attacks with proven techniques (OWASP Top 10, MITRE ATT&CK)
- ✅ **Architecture-Specific Vulnerabilities**: Threats that exploit specific technology choices or configurations
- ✅ **Configuration Weaknesses**: Attacks that exploit likely misconfigurations or default settings
- ✅ **Process Failures**: Threats that exploit probable human error or process gaps
- ✅ **Supply Chain Risks**: Realistic third-party and dependency-related threats

**Avoid These Threat Types:**
- ❌ **Zero-Day Dependencies**: Threats that require unknown/unpatched vulnerabilities unless justified by threat landscape
- ❌ **Nation-State Capabilities**: Advanced persistent threats unless the organization profile warrants such attention
- ❌ **Theoretical Vulnerabilities**: Academic attacks without practical exploitation methods
- ❌ **Disproportionate Effort**: Complex attacks where simpler alternatives achieve the same objective
- ❌ **Impossible Prerequisites**: Attacks requiring conditions that contradict stated assumptions or architectural constraints

**Contextual Validation Framework:**

For each threat, validate against these contextual factors:

**Organizational Context:**
- Industry sector and typical threat landscape
- Organization size and security maturity level
- Regulatory environment and compliance requirements
- Business criticality and asset value

**Technical Context:**
- Deployment model (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)
- Network architecture and security boundaries
- Technology stack and version currency
- Existing security controls and monitoring capabilities

**Operational Context:**
- User behavior patterns and access requirements
- Development and deployment processes
- Incident response and recovery capabilities
- Third-party dependencies and integration points

**Detailed Threat Analysis:**

For each validated threat:

1. **Threat description and attack scenario**:
   - Describe the specific attack method and technique
   - Outline the step-by-step attack progression
   - Identify required attacker capabilities and resources
   - Document attack prerequisites and conditions

2. **Impact assessment**:
   - Evaluate business impact and consequences
   - Assess technical impact on system functionality
   - Consider cascading effects and secondary impacts
   - Quantify potential damages and losses

3. **Likelihood evaluation**:
   - Assess threat actor motivation and capability
   - Evaluate attack complexity and feasibility
   - Consider existing controls and barriers
   - Factor in industry trends and threat intelligence

4. **Risk prioritization**:
   - Calculate risk scores based on likelihood and impact
   - Prioritize threats for remediation attention
   - Consider business context and risk tolerance
   - Account for regulatory and compliance implications

### Phase 7: Security Requirements Definition

**Requirements Derivation:**

Based on identified threats, define specific security requirements:

1. **Authentication requirements**:

   - Validate risk assessments with business stakeholders
   - Obtain formal approval and sign-off

### Phase 9: Multi-Environment Threat Analysis

**Environment-Specific Threat Modeling:**

Consider creating separate threat models for different environments and phases:

1. **Application/Runtime Threat Model**:
   - Focus on application logic and user interactions
   - Analyze API endpoints, authentication flows, and data processing
   - Include third-party integrations and external dependencies
   - Document STRIDE threats specific to application functionality

2. **Deployment Threat Model**:
   - Focus on infrastructure and deployment security
   - Analyze cloud services, container security, and network configurations

   - Include developer workstation and CI/CD security
   - Document supply chain and build-time security risks

### Phase 10: Enhanced Gap Analysis with Stop/Continue Decision Framework

**Step 3: Gap Identification and Prioritization**

**Critical Gap Assessment:**
Identify gaps in these priority order:
