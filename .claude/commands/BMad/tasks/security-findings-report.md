### 4. Risk Assessment and Prioritization

**Risk Matrix Development:**
- Create visual risk matrix showing likelihood vs. impact
- Plot vulnerabilities on risk matrix for prioritization
- Group related vulnerabilities for coordinated remediation
- Highlight quick wins and high-impact improvements

**Remediation Prioritization:**
- **Critical Priority**: Immediate remediation required (0-30 days)
- **High Priority**: Near-term remediation required (1-3 months)
- **Medium Priority**: Planned remediation (3-6 months)
- **Low Priority**: Long-term improvement (6+ months)

**Resource Planning:**
- Estimate effort and resources required for each priority tier
- Identify skills and expertise needed for remediation activities
- Consider budget implications and cost-benefit analysis
- Plan coordination requirements across teams and departments

### 5. Compliance and Standards Mapping

**Regulatory Compliance Assessment:**

**Standards Alignment:**
- Reference applicable security frameworks (OWASP, NIST, ISO 27001)
- Map findings to specific framework controls and requirements
- Identify areas of good practice and areas needing improvement
- Provide framework-specific recommendations and guidance

### 6. Metrics and Trend Analysis

**Security Metrics:**
- Calculate vulnerability density and distribution metrics
