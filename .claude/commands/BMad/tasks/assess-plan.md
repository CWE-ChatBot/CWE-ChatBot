When this command is used, execute the following task:

# assess-plan

Reviews a completed PRD (Product Requirements Document) and architecture documentation to determine if additional security considerations are needed and provides comprehensive security assessment.

## Prerequisites

- Completed PRD document available in docs/
- Architecture documentation available in docs/ 
- Access to existing security standards and frameworks

## Assessment Process

1. **Document Review**
   - Read the complete PRD including all requirements and specifications
   - Review architecture diagrams, data flows, and system components
   - Identify all stakeholders, data types, and integration points
   - Note any existing security requirements or considerations mentioned

2. **Threat Surface Analysis**
   - Map all potential attack vectors and entry points
   - Identify sensitive data flows and storage locations
   - Analyze external interfaces and third-party integrations
   - Evaluate user access patterns and privilege requirements
   - Assess network communications and protocols

3. **Risk Assessment Matrix**
   - Categorize identified threats by likelihood and impact
   - Prioritize security concerns based on business risk
   - Identify critical security gaps requiring immediate attention
   - Evaluate regulatory and compliance requirements

4. **Security Architecture Review**
   - Assess proposed authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Review data protection and encryption strategies
   - Evaluate logging, monitoring, and incident response capabilities
   - Analyze security controls and defensive measures
   - Check for adherence to security best practices and patterns

5. **Compliance and Standards Check**
   - Verify alignment with relevant security frameworks (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
   - Check compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
   - Validate security standards implementation
   - Assess audit trail and documentation requirements

## Security Assessment Output

Create or update a "Security Assessment" section in the reviewed document:

## Key Focus Areas

### Data Security
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Encryption requirements (at rest, in transit, in processing)
- Data retention and disposal policies
- Privacy protection mechanisms

### Access Control
- Authentication mechanisms and strength requirements
- Authorization models and role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Session management and timeout policies

### Infrastructure Security
- Network segmentation and firewalling
- Secure configuration management
- Patch management procedures
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting

### Application Security
- Secure coding practices and standards
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding and XSS protection
- SQL injection prevention
- CSRF protection mechanisms

### Operational Security
- Security incident response procedures
- Backup and disaster recovery planning
- Security awareness and training requirements
- Vendor and third-party security assessments

## Escalation Criteria

Flag for immediate escalation if:
- Critical security vulnerabilities are identified that could lead to data breach
- Regulatory compliance violations are discovered
- Insufficient security controls for high-risk data processing
- Missing fundamental security architecture components
- Third-party integrations lack proper security validation

## Completion

After assessment:
1. Document all findings in the Security Assessment section
2. Prioritize recommendations by risk level and business impact  
3. Provide clear actionable next steps
4. Schedule follow-up reviews as needed
5. Coordinate with other team members (architect, PM, dev) on implementation planning
