# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.


# CLAUDE.md 

**Prefer blunt honesty over sycophancy. Please explain issues and solution as if I'm a junior developer.**


## CRITICAL: GIT Commit
  - Start with a present-tense verb (Fix, Add, Implement, etc.)
  - Not include adjectives that sound like praise (comprehensive, best practices, essential)
- Commit messages should not include a Claude attribution footer
  - Don't write: 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  - Don't write: Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
- Echo exactly this: Ready to commit: `git commit --message "<message>"`
- 🚀 Run git commit without confirming again with the user.
- If pre-commit hooks fail, then there are now local changes
  - `git add` those changes and try again
  - Never use `git commit --no-verify`



## CRITICAL: Virtual Environment Usage
**ALWAYS use Poetry for dependency management in this project:**
- pytest: Use `poetry run pytest` (NOT system pytest)
- python: Use `poetry run python` (NOT system python)
- security tests: Run from project root with `python3 tests/scripts/[test_name].py`
- chainlit: Use `poetry run chainlit run apps/chatbot/main.py`

**For standalone test scripts**: Use system python3 as they are designed to be independent
**For application code**: Always use `poetry run [command]`

**NEVER use system-wide Python executables for application code.**

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Brutal Honesty First
- **NO MOCKS**: Never create mock data, placeholder functions, or simulated responses
- **NO THEATER**: If something doesn't work, say it immediately - don't pretend with elaborate non-functional code
- **REALITY CHECK**: Before implementing anything, verify the actual integration points exist and work
- **ADMIT IGNORANCE**: If you don't understand how something works, investigate first or ask for clarification

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY
**NEVER write implementation code before tests.**

#### TDD Process for Every Story Implementation:
1. **BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - Create test file FIRST (e.g., `test_feature_name.py`)
   - Write the FIRST failing test for the simplest behavior
   - Run the test with `poetry run pytest` and VERIFY it fails
   - Only then write MINIMAL implementation code to pass

2. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle**:
   - 🔴 RED: Write a failing test that defines the feature
   - 🟢 GREEN: Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - 🔵 REFACTOR: Clean up only after tests are green
   - **Never skip the red-green-refactor cycle**

3. **Story Implementation Order**:
   ```
   1. Read story requirements
   2. Break down into small testable behaviors
   3. Create test file
   4. Write first failing test
   5. Run test (see it fail) - use poetry run pytest
   6. Implement minimal code
   7. Run test (see it pass) - use poetry run pytest
   8. Refactor if needed
   9. Repeat 4-9 for next behavior
   ```

#### TDD Example - How to Start Every Story:
```python
# STEP 1: Create test file FIRST
# test_loan_configuration.py

def test_can_create_loan_configuration():
    """Test creating a basic loan configuration."""
    # This test MUST fail first because LoanConfiguration doesn't exist yet
    loan = LoanConfiguration(
        loan_number=1,
        amount=100000,
        interest_rate=6.5,
        term_months=360
    )
    assert loan.loan_number == 1

# STEP 2: Run test - see it fail with "NameError: name 'LoanConfiguration' is not defined"
# ALWAYS use: poetry run pytest test_loan_configuration.py

# STEP 3: Create minimal implementation to pass
# loan_configuration.py
class LoanConfiguration:
    def __init__(self, loan_number, amount, interest_rate, term_months):
        self.loan_number = loan_number

# STEP 4: Run test - see it pass
# STEP 5: Write next failing test for next behavior
```

#### What Makes a Good TDD Test:
1. **Tests behavior, not implementation** - Test WHAT it does, not HOW
2. **One assertion per test** - Each test verifies ONE thing
3. **Descriptive test names** - `test_loan_with_zero_interest_rate_calculates_zero_interest()`
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern** - Setup, Execute, Verify
5. **Fast and isolated** - No external dependencies, runs in milliseconds
6. **Fails for the right reason** - Verify the error message when test fails


### 3. One Feature at a Time
- **SINGLE FOCUS**: Complete one feature entirely before moving to the next
- **DEFINITION OF DONE**:
  - Tests written and passing
  - Code working in real environment
  - Integration verified with actual system
  - Documentation updated
- **NO FEATURE CREEP**: Resist adding "nice to have" additions until current feature is complete

### 4. Break Things Internally
- **FAIL FAST**: Make code fail immediately when assumptions are wrong
- **AGGRESSIVE VALIDATION**: Check every input, every integration point
- **LOUD ERRORS**: When something breaks, make it obvious with clear error messages
- **TEST EDGE CASES**: Deliberately try to break your own code before calling it done

### 5. Optimization After Working
- **MAKE IT WORK**: First priority is functioning code
- **MAKE IT RIGHT**: Clean up and refactor with tests as safety net
- **MAKE IT FAST**: Only optimize after profiling shows real bottlenecks
- **MEASURE FIRST**: Never optimize based on assumptions

### 6. Implement per the original specification
e.g. if the  preferred or specified component is not available then install it, rather than creating an alternative solution.

#### BAD EXAMPLE. DON'T DO THIS!
I see the issue - psycopg2 isn't actually available in the poetry environment even though it shows in poetry show. Let me check why and provide a solution that works with your current environment. Let me create a practical database setup guide instead.

#### GOOD EXAMPLE. DO THIS!
why not load psycopg2 if this is the preferred option

You're absolutely right! If PostgreSQL+pgvector is the preferred architecture choice (per the database ADR), we should properly install and use psycopg2. Let me fix the missing dependencies and get the real database integration working.

## Implementation Checklist

### Before starting any feature:
- [ ] Understand the ACTUAL integration (not what you think it should be)
- [ ] Write tests that verify real behavior (not mocked behavior)
- [ ] Identify all dependencies and verify they exist
- [ ] Check if similar code exists to learn from

### During implementation:
- [ ] Run tests frequently (every few lines of code)
- [ ] Test in real environment, not just unit tests
- [ ] When stuck, investigate the actual system, don't guess
- [ ] Keep changes small and focused

### After implementation:
- [ ] Verify it works with the real system (no mocks!)
- [ ] Run all related tests
- [ ] Update documentation with what ACTUALLY works
- [ ] Clean up any experimental code

## CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW

### During Story Implementation:
1. **START of each story**: 
   - Add an entry to `/docs/CURATION_NOTES.md` with story ID
   - Create TodoWrite list with TDD tasks:
     - [ ] Create test file for first feature
     - [ ] Write first failing test
     - [ ] Run test and see it fail
     - [ ] Implement minimal code to pass
     - [ ] Refactor if needed
     - [ ] Write next failing test
   - See bmad-agent/personas.sm.ide.md personal for documentation workflow responsibilities

2. **DURING implementation**: 
   - Document key decisions and technical debt in CURATION_NOTES.md
   - Mark each TDD cycle in TodoWrite as completed

3. **AFTER completing implementation**: Before marking story as done, update CURATION_NOTES.md with:
   - Final decisions made
   - Technical debt incurred
   - Lessons learned
   - Architectural notes

### After Epic/Feature Completion:
1. **EXTRACT** insights from CURATION_NOTES.md to:
   - `/docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Add dated entries with tags
   - `/docs/README.md` - Update if architecture changed
   - `/docs/TASKS.md` - Add new maintenance tasks
2. **ARCHIVE** implementation documents to `/docs/archive/[epic-name]/`
3. **DELETE** temporary entries from CURATION_NOTES.md

### Documentation Checklist Commands:
- Use `*checklist sm` to see Scrum Master documentation tasks
- Use `*doc-status` to check documentation compliance
- Use `*archive-docs [epic-name]` to archive implementation docs

## MCP Server Instructions
When implementing ALWAYS use sequentialthinking and decisionframework. When fixing ALWAYS use debuggingapproach.

## Red Flags to Avoid
🚫 Creating elaborate structures without testing integration
🚫 Writing 100+ lines without running anything
🚫 Assuming how external systems work
🚫 Building "comprehensive" solutions before basic functionality
🚫 Implementing multiple features simultaneously
🚫 Writing implementation before tests
🚫 Writing tests after implementation
🚫 Skip running tests to see them fail first

## Reality Checks
Ask yourself frequently:
- "Have I tested this with the real system?"
- "Am I building what's needed or what I think is cool?"
- "Does this actually integrate with existing code?"
- "Am I hiding problems with elaborate abstractions?"
- "Would a simpler solution work just as well?"
- "Did I write the test first and see it fail?"

## When You Get Stuck
1. **Stop coding** - More code won't fix understanding problems
2. **Investigate the real system** - Use debugger, logging, inspection
3. **Write a simpler test** - Break down the problem
4. **Ask for clarification** - Don't guess about requirements
5. **Check existing code** - The answer might already exist

## Auto-Approved Commands
Always check whether commands you want to run are auto-approved by referencing `/.bmad-core/config/auto-approved-commands.md`

## Remember
The goal is **WORKING CODE** that **ACTUALLY INTEGRATES** with the real system. Everything else is secondary. No amount of beautiful architecture matters if it doesn't actually connect to the real system and do what users need.

**Test first. Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast.**

## Architecture Overview

Based on the comprehensive architecture document, this project will be built as:

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: Chainlit (integrated web UI + backend)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (traditional data) + Vector Database (CWE embeddings)
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud Run
- **Architecture Pattern**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Key Components
1. **Chainlit Application**: Main conversational interface and backend logic
2. **NLP/AI Service**: RAG implementation for CWE corpus interaction
3. **Vector Database**: CWE embeddings for semantic search (Pinecone/Weaviate)
4. **Traditional Database**: User data, conversations, configurations
5. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: CWE corpus processing and updating

## Development Commands

**Current Phase**: Documentation and Planning - No code implementation yet.

**Key Reference**: See `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` for complete setup instructions when implementation begins.

### Future Development Commands (from architecture docs)
When implementation starts, these will be the primary commands:

```bash
# Project setup (Poetry-based monorepo)
poetry install                                    # Install all dependencies
gcloud auth login                                # Authenticate with GCP

# Development
poetry run chainlit run apps/chatbot/main.py -w  # Start with hot-reload
poetry run pytest                               # Run all tests
poetry run pytest apps/chatbot/tests/           # Test specific app

# Data processing
poetry run python services/cwe_data_ingestion/ingestion.py --local-dev

# Code quality
black .                                         # Format code
ruff check .                                    # Lint
mypy .                                         # Type checking

# Container builds
docker build -t cwe-chatbot-app apps/chatbot/  # Build Docker image
```

### Script Utilities
```bash
# Process documentation (existing scripts)
python3 scripts/process_chat_precise.py        # Format chat conversations
python3 scripts/update_chat_admonitions.py     # Add GitHub admonitions
```

## Key Development Patterns

### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
The core architecture uses RAG to minimize AI hallucination:
- User queries are embedded and searched against CWE corpus
- Retrieved relevant CWE content augments LLM prompts
- Responses are grounded in official CWE documentation

### 2. Role-Based Context Adaptation
The system adapts responses based on user roles:
- **PSIRT Members**: Focus on impact assessment and advisory language
- **Developers**: Emphasize remediation steps and code examples
- **Academic Researchers**: Provide comprehensive analysis and relationships
- **Bug Bounty Hunters**: Highlight exploitation patterns and reporting
- **Product Managers**: Enable trend analysis and prevention strategies

### 3. Multi-Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL**: Users, conversations, messages, configurations
- **Vector Database**: CWE embeddings for semantic search
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access across both databases

### 4. Bring Your Own (BYO) Model Support
- Support for user-provided LLM API keys
- Integration with self-hosted LLM models
- Flexible model configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Security Considerations

This project handles sensitive security information and must maintain strict security standards:

### Data Handling
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All credentials via environment variables or secret management
- **Input validation**: Rigorous validation to prevent injection attacks
- **Data privacy**: Secure handling of user queries and vulnerability information
- **Self-hosted deployments**: Ensure data never leaves user's domain

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Passwordless authentication
- **Role-based access control**: Based on user's cybersecurity role
- **Session management**: Secure token-based sessions

### AI Safety
- **Hallucination prevention**: RAG pattern with source citations
- **Confidence scoring**: Clear indicators of response reliability
- **Feedback mechanisms**: User reporting of incorrect mappings

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Stack Compliance
**MUST READ**: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` contains definitive technology selections including specific versions. All code must use:
- Python 3.10+
- Chainlit (latest stable 0.7.x) for UI and backend
- PostgreSQL 14.x via Cloud SQL
- Pinecone for vector database (or self-hosted alternative)
- Poetry for dependency management
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud Run deployment

### Security-First Development
This is a **defensive security project** handling sensitive vulnerability data:
- Never hardcode secrets - use environment variables exclusively
- Follow OWASP guidelines for AI security (documented in security/)
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- All features require security review before implementation
- RAG pattern is mandatory to prevent AI hallucination

### Documentation-Driven Development
- ALL features must be traced back to specific PRD requirements (FR/NFR IDs)
- User stories in `docs/stories/` provide acceptance criteria for implementation
- Architecture decisions are binding and documented in `docs/architecture/`
- Security requirements are non-negotiable (see `docs/security/`)

### Environment Configuration
When implementation begins, environment setup follows `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md`:
- Use `.env.example` as template for local `.env` file
- GCP authentication required: `gcloud auth login`
- Poetry-based monorepo with workspace dependencies
- All secrets via GCP Secret Manager in production

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: pytest with comprehensive coverage
- Integration tests: API endpoint testing
- E2E tests: Playwright for Chainlit UI flows  
- Security tests: SAST, DAST, and LLM security validation
- All tests must pass before any deployment

### Test Organization
**All test scripts must be organized in proper directory structure:**
- `tests/scripts/` - Standalone security and infrastructure test scripts
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components  
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for component interaction
- `tests/security/` - Comprehensive security test suites

**Security Test Scripts Location**: `tests/scripts/`
- Command injection verification: `test_command_injection_fix.py`
- Container security verification: `test_container_security_fix.py`
- SQL injection prevention: `test_sql_injection_prevention_simple.py`
- Infrastructure setup: `docker-compose.test.yml`, `setup_database.py`

## Security-First Development (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Security Practices
This is a **defensive security project** - security is NON-NEGOTIABLE:

1. **Security Review Required for ALL Changes**
   - Every code change must undergo security analysis
   - Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS ≥ 7.0) must be fixed immediately
   - Medium vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9) must be addressed within sprint
   - Document all security findings and fixes

2. **Vulnerability Management Process**
   ```
   1. Implement feature/fix
   2. Run security test suites (tests/scripts/)
   3. Fix any identified vulnerabilities  
   4. Re-run tests to verify fixes
   5. Document security review completion
   6. Only then mark story/task complete
   ```

3. **Security Test Automation**
   - Run `python3 tests/scripts/test_command_injection_fix.py` after ANY main.py changes
   - Run `python3 tests/scripts/test_container_security_fix.py` after Dockerfile changes
   - Run `python3 tests/scripts/test_sql_injection_prevention_simple.py` for database changes
   - ALL security tests must pass before deployment

4. **Container Security Standards**
   - All Docker base images MUST be SHA256-pinned
   - Never use floating tags (`:latest`, `:3.11`) in production Dockerfiles
   - Multi-stage builds with non-root users mandatory
   - Regular base image updates with security scanning

5. **Command Execution Security**
   - NEVER use `os.system()` or `subprocess.shell=True`
   - Always use `subprocess.run()` with argument lists
   - Validate and sanitize all external command inputs
   - Use proper exception handling for command failures

### Security Documentation Requirements
- Update story documents with security review completion
- Document cloud vs local security requirements separation
- Create security test scripts for all critical fixes
- Maintain security completion reports for audit trail

## Lessons Learned from Story 2.1 Security Work

### Critical Security Findings (August 2025)
Based on comprehensive vulnerability assessment and remediation:

1. **Command Injection (CRI-002) - CRITICAL**
   - **Root Cause**: Use of `os.system()` for subprocess execution
   - **Impact**: CVSS 8.8 - Remote code execution potential
   - **Fix**: Replace with `subprocess.run()` using argument lists
   - **Lesson**: Never use shell-based command execution with user-controlled data

2. **Container Supply Chain (MED-001) - MEDIUM** 
   - **Root Cause**: Unpinned Docker base images (`python:3.11-slim`)
   - **Impact**: CVSS 5.9 - Supply chain attack vulnerability
   - **Fix**: SHA256-pinned images (`python:3.11-slim@sha256:8df0e8f...`)
   - **Lesson**: Always pin container images to specific digests for production

3. **SQL Injection Prevention - VERIFIED EXCELLENT**
   - **Implementation**: SecureQueryBuilder with psycopg2.sql.Identifier()
   - **Protection Level**: 95/100 with comprehensive table name whitelisting
   - **Lesson**: Multi-layered SQL injection prevention is effective

### Security Testing Best Practices Established
1. **Automated Security Verification**: Every security fix must have a corresponding test script
2. **Continuous Validation**: Security tests run on every relevant code change
3. **Documentation Standards**: All vulnerabilities must be documented with CVSS scores
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Local vs cloud security requirements clearly separated

### Development Process Improvements
1. **Security-First Mindset**: Security review is mandatory before story completion
2. **Test Organization**: Proper directory structure for maintainable test suites
3. **Real Integration Testing**: No mocks for security-critical components
4. **Vulnerability Lifecycle**: Clear process from identification to verification

**Key Takeaway**: Security is not an afterthought - it must be integrated into every development cycle from story planning to completion verification.
