## Architecture Overview

Based on the comprehensive architecture document, this project will be built as:

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: Chainlit (integrated web UI + backend)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (traditional data) + Vector Database (CWE embeddings)
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud Run
- **Architecture Pattern**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Key Components
1. **Chainlit Application**: Main conversational interface and backend logic
2. **NLP/AI Service**: RAG implementation for CWE corpus interaction
3. **Vector Database**: CWE embeddings for semantic search (Pinecone/Weaviate)
4. **Traditional Database**: User data, conversations, configurations
5. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: CWE corpus processing and updating

## Development Commands

**Current Phase**: Documentation and Planning - No code implementation yet.

**Key Reference**: See `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` for complete setup instructions when implementation begins.

### Future Development Commands (from architecture docs)
When implementation starts, these will be the primary commands:

```bash
# Project setup (Poetry-based monorepo)
poetry install                                    # Install all dependencies
gcloud auth login                                # Authenticate with GCP

# Development
poetry run chainlit run apps/chatbot/main.py -w  # Start with hot-reload
poetry run pytest                               # Run all tests
poetry run pytest apps/chatbot/tests/           # Test specific app

# Data processing
poetry run python services/cwe_data_ingestion/ingestion.py --local-dev

# Code quality

# Container builds
docker build -t cwe-chatbot-app apps/chatbot/  # Build Docker image
```

### Script Utilities
```bash
# Process documentation (existing scripts)
python3 scripts/process_chat_precise.py        # Format chat conversations
python3 scripts/update_chat_admonitions.py     # Add GitHub admonitions
```

## Key Development Patterns

### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
The core architecture uses RAG to minimize AI hallucination:
- User queries are embedded and searched against CWE corpus
- Retrieved relevant CWE content augments LLM prompts
- Responses are grounded in official CWE documentation

### 2. Role-Based Context Adaptation
The system adapts responses based on user roles:
- **PSIRT Members**: Focus on impact assessment and advisory language
- **Developers**: Emphasize remediation steps and code examples
- **Academic Researchers**: Provide comprehensive analysis and relationships
- **Bug Bounty Hunters**: Highlight exploitation patterns and reporting
- **Product Managers**: Enable trend analysis and prevention strategies

### 3. Multi-Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL**: Users, conversations, messages, configurations
- **Vector Database**: CWE embeddings for semantic search
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access across both databases

### 4. Bring Your Own (BYO) Model Support
- Support for user-provided LLM API keys
- Integration with self-hosted LLM models
- Flexible model configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Security Considerations

This project handles sensitive security information and must maintain strict security standards:

### Data Handling
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All credentials via environment variables or secret management
- **Input validation**: Rigorous validation to prevent injection attacks
- **Data privacy**: Secure handling of user queries and vulnerability information
- **Self-hosted deployments**: Ensure data never leaves user's domain

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Passwordless authentication
- **Role-based access control**: Based on user's cybersecurity role
- **Session management**: Secure token-based sessions

### AI Safety
- **Hallucination prevention**: RAG pattern with source citations
- **Confidence scoring**: Clear indicators of response reliability
- **Feedback mechanisms**: User reporting of incorrect mappings
