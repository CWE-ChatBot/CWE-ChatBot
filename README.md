# CWE ChatBot

A conversational AI application designed to revolutionize interaction with the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) corpus.

## Overview

The CWE ChatBot enables cybersecurity professionals to interact with CWE data through natural language conversations, providing contextual, role-based responses for vulnerability analysis and prevention.

## Project Structure

This project consists of **3 separate parts**:

1. **CWE Corpus Ingestion** (`apps/cwe_ingestion/`) - Ingestion of CWE corpus to a database with both text and embeddings
   - [📖 CWE Ingestion README](apps/cwe_ingestion/README.md)

2. **Chatbot Application** (`apps/chatbot/`) - Interactive conversational interface for CWE analysis
   - [📖 Chatbot README](apps/chatbot/README.md)

3. **PDF Upload Functionality** (`apps/pdf_worker/`) - Ephemeral PDF processing deployed as a separate Cloud Function
   - [📖 PDF Worker README](apps/pdf_worker/README.md)

## Personas

The CWE ChatBot provides different personas to tailor the conversation to your specific needs. You can select a persona from the dropdown menu in the chat interface.

*   **PSIRT Member** 🛡️ - Impact assessment and security advisory creation
*   **Developer** 💻 - Remediation steps and secure coding examples
*   **Academic Researcher** 🎓 - Comprehensive analysis and CWE relationships
*   **Bug Bounty Hunter** 🔍 - Exploitation patterns and testing techniques
*   **Product Manager** 📊 - Business impact and prevention strategies
*   **CWE Analyzer** 🔬 - CVE-to-CWE mapping analysis with confidence scoring
*   **CVE Creator** 📝 - Structured CVE vulnerability descriptions
